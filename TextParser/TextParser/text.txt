               ones ever. What, exactly, causes homosexuality? Some would say it is a gene, passed
               on from parents to child. Others would argue that it is a result of a child’s
               upbringing. Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be
               cured. Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these? No one knows for sure, and
               it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming
               up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter.
            Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of
               the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond).
               In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue
               males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood,
               and take pleasure in physical contact with men” (qtd. in Isay 11). This shows that
               not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he
               also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word “boyhood” signifies. In
               fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only
               “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy. Furthermore, there were many
               occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have
               had 14 male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior. Even Homer wrote about
               Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love
               (Emond).
            But it was not until 1869 that the term “homosexual” was first used, to describe “a
               man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex”
               (Marcus 1). (However, for the purposes of this paper, homosexuality will be looked at
               solely in terms of men). At this point in time, Karl Maria Kertbeny used the word in
               a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of Prussia.
               Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for
               “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are
               for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1).
            It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was
               started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist,
               homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed
               that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10). Hirschfeld also founded the
               Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897. The
               committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a
               great amount of prestige in his field. He became known as one of the founding fathers
               of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological
               institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed
               by the Nazis 15 years later. Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl
               Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of
               homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with
               the use of hormone injections. This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned
               to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs,
               starting in1864. The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa,
               which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic
               desire. Ulrichs believed that Urnings were attracted to other males because they were
               “hermaphrodites of the mind,” meaning while they may have been male in body, they
               were female in soul and mind, leading them to be naturally attracted to males in
               terms of sexual partners. This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law
               adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their
               unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon
               individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable . Ulrichs claimed
               that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn (Wikholm).
            A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed
               homosexuality to be a natural behavior. In an interview in 1903, he professed his
               beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick
               people… Homosexual persons are not sick. They also do not belong in a court of law!”
               (qtd. in Isay 3). In 1935, he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous “Letter
               to an American Mother” of a homosexual, which stated that “Homosexuality is assuredly
               no advantage, but is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be
               classified as an illness… Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern
               times have been homosexuals” (qtd. in Isay 3).
            However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical
               professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness. Treatments such as
               castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted
               cures. By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common “cure,” and many
               homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual
               preference (Dudley 125).
            Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in
               the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud. In this courageous
               experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual
               and half heterosexual. She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that
               homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant
               psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; “gay” men were no
               more insane than their “straight” counterparts (Marcus 183).
            Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an
               illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who
               has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American
               Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the
               Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973. Just over
               a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from
               their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11). The American Psychological Association
               further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of
               Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual
               Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure”
               homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment. It stated, rather that
               homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person,
               but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one
               (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation).
            Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael
               Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard
               Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of
               Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics. For
               two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both
               monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg
               and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins
               from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than
               that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males
               (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment). In
               total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their
               adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as
               homosexual, either by self-identification or other means. Out of the 56 homosexual
               males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin
               brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately
               22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 %
               of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of
               genetics. Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that
               were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %,
               had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of
               homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard).
            More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a “choice,”
               but rather a feeling that one is born with. As one grows older, they become aware of
               sexual feelings towards other persons. The only difference between homosexuals and
               heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite
               sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex. Therefore, neither
               homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter, and asking a
               homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking
               a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?” After all, why
               would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle? As a homosexual, one risks horrifying
               their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact
               with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for
               publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more. Rather, the only actual
               choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference;
               whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings,
               or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus
               9).
            To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with
               two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods. Both were asked how
               what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they
               realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions. Both believed
               that homosexual was a result of nature, rather than nurture (Dobbens & Woods).
               Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual;
               “They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’ (Dobbens). Dobbens believes that he
               was born homosexual. When why he was a homosexual, he explained “It’s just the way
               you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the
               world was made – no one really knows” (Dobbens). He went on to explain that while his
               nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it. When
               discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality, he commented
               “They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring
               you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted],
               so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you
               accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends
               on how you’re brought up” (Dobbens). Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and
               justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than
               nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to
               anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods). When asked why he was gay, he explained that
               it is simply “something that I can’t help… embedded in my head; nothing made me do
               it” (Woods). He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction
               between males and females, only it was between males and other males. He added that
               “nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there. I’ve always been
               attracted to guys” (Woods). What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that
               he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is
               romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend
               and to be close with other females, etc… but never in a sexual sense. Though he has
               “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come
               from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods). He says
               that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work
               it out. He then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic;
               “It’s like race. It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s
               internal, you can’t help it” (Woods). When asked if he thought homosexuality was
               caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct. He
               gave the example of birds, which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build
               a next, or catch their prey. Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something
               in the development of the embryo. All in all, Woods views homosexuality as
               “fascinating.” His final thought: “I also believe everyone has at least one
               homosexual attraction. It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a
               spectrum” (Woods).
            Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics. According to
               Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while
               the disadvantageous ones eventually die out. For instance, heterosexual males have an
               average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to
               reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to
               females. Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of
               the disadvantageous traits. Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five
               times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was
               indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been
               reduced immensely in the number of occurrences. Since neither of these events have
               yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene
               (Fulkerson).
            My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no
               definitive answer on what causes homosexuality. No one knows for sure now (although
               many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth. Nonetheless,
               I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of
               genetic and environmental causes. Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition
               towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations. However this
               does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be
               triggered by environmental factors. This is why Bailey and Pillard found in their
               study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same
               genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality, this was not the case 100 % of
               the time. This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write
               this, new studies are being done. Perhaps the truth is right around the corner.

Zoot Suit
A style of suit worn by African Americans, Filipino Americans, and Mexican Americans during the 1930s and 1940s. In Chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the 1940s. The fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs, long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads, thick-soled shoes, and long watch chains dangling from the belt. An addition to the whole style common to Chicanos was a particular haircut, long with a ducktail and a wide-brimmed hat.
The word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of Harlem, and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style. Many African Americans wore an extravagant style of clothing, the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders, that later became known as the zoot suit. In the novel Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, he describes the zoot--suiters’ style, “walking slowly, their shoulders swaying, their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles; their coats long and hip-tight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men” (1947, 380). In the late-night jazz scenes of Harlem this style was “a killer-diller coat with a drape-shape, reat-pleats and shoulders padded like a lunatic’s cell” (380). Tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume, which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing. The broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth, and the finger-tipped coat was made for fun and leisure. The long baggy pants were made for dancing, especially the jitterbug, and the wide Panama hats were another sign of adulthood. “The business of fun, dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by Zoot-Suiters. It was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of free-wheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture” (Tyler, 23). Prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit, such as Cab Calloway, Sammy Davis Jr., and Duke Ellington. Ellington performed at the Orpheum in Los Angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called Jump for Joy in which the performers wore zoot suits, also known as Gone with the Wind suits, after the style worn by Clark Gable in the movie by the same name.
Even though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities, it is primarily identified with the pachucos of Los Angeles. Pachucos were mostly second-generation Mexicans, the sons of migrant laborers and working-class immigrants. Pachucos created their own subculture, an arrogant style of dressing, a bilingual secret argot, and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs. The zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zoot-suiter as neither a Mexican nor an American. It was not a bicultural or binational position, but rather a position between cultures, a “hanging in space” position. The overly confident, slow swagger of the pachuco, today exemplified by the cholo, made it appear in fact as if the zoot-suiter were walking on air.
During the summer of 1943 the attention of the whole country was on Los Angeles when gangs of sailors and zoot-suiters battled with each other in the streets of the city. It is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked, beat, and stripped young Mexican Americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zoot-suiters. Between the third and thirteenth of June zoot-suiters were open targets. Much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives.
During the late 1970s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by Luis Valdez. In 1981 a film by the same name, Zoot Suit, was produced and directed by Luis Valdez, with performances by actors Daniel Valdez and Edward James Olmos.

Zozobra
A giant, forty-foot effigy in the form of a puppet, which is burned during the annual Santa Fe Fiesta held in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The word Zozobra translates to “gloom” or “worry” or “anguished.” The Zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta, which symbolizes the end of destructiveness, gloom, and worry, setting the tone for a successful fiesta. The creation of Zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by Will Shuster, who felt that the fiesta had become “dull and commercialized.” Throughout the years the image of Zozobra changed from a simple twenty-foot puppet to the elaborate forty-foot figure with animated eyes, arms, and mouth that he is today. In 1969 Shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of Zozobra to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe. He is hung on a tall pole on a hill, outside the city, where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch. The death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness.
In response to the tradition of the burning of Zozobra, a group of New Mexico Chicanos started a tradition of burning El Kookoóee, a figure known by many Chicanos as the bogeyman, during the Festival de Otoño.

               A Physics of Semantics?
            
            
               Each of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory.
               Each is tentative and incomplete, pointing but not fully adequate.
               Yet, I persistently hope, it is better to light one candle against...what? the darkness? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before?
               There are grounds, reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries, to doubt a physics of semantics.
               We are on shaky ground.
               Yet when the first hard frost comes, when the birches have been swung, their crimson leaves scattered carelessly, when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn, long-legged, knowing how winter is thin, when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams, small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where, perhaps, something new is to be found.
            
            
               We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent, able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady, powerful flight.
               The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom, and perhaps more than the vaunted quark.
               But autonomous agents, we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf, we to whom "intentionality" and "purpose" are so inevitably attributed by our common languages, we are, by my definition of autonomous agents, also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties.
               If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more, a properdefinition of life itself, then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where "purpose" is ascribed by all of us to one another.
            
            
               Semantics enters with purpose.
               For this to be true, it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose, say, the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient, be conscious.
            
            
               I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful, an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle, now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work, then do extract work, propagating work and constraint construction, from their environment.
            
            
               Know-how
            
            
               Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now, plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material.
            
            
               I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had, individually and collectively, the embodied know-how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world.
               Indeed, as I have emphasized before, a biosphere is a self-consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents, ways of making a living, and the search procedures, mutation, recombination, as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents.
               Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of "jobs" that were widely filled, the abundant niches of the bio-sphere.
               There is in this whole self-constructing system a wider know-how, beyond the know-how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment.
               Yet, clearly, the know-how is distributed.
               There is no autonomous agent, no one, who knows how the whole system works, any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions, deals, steals, hopes, and frustrations.
            
            
               What in the world is "know-how"?
               Philosophers distinguish between "know-how" and "know that."
               I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums.
               "Know that" concerns propositions, most conveniently, human propositions.
               I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese.
               I know that the earth circles the sun, that the earth is roughly spherical, that chairs are used to sit on.
               "Know that" brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world.
               Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can "know that" with respect to propositions.
            
            
               Unlike "know that," "know-how" does not involve propositions about the world.
               "Know-how" involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world.
               The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest, the athletic genius high jumping, have the know-how to do it.
            
            
               Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world?
               I certainly want to say yes, without attributing consciousness in any way.
               Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes, metabolic switching, mechanical twitching, sensing of glucose gradient, swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations.
               It knows how all right, even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business.
               But then, try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention.
            
            
               Thank God for know-how.
               Know that is a thin veneer on a four-billion-year-old know-how skill abundant in the biosphere.
               But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents, it would seem, is also graced by the selfsame know-how.
               If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms, they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them.
            
            
               The know-how is, in these terms, nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis, work tasks, sensing, recording, and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents.
               The know-how is not outside that propagating organization.
               The know-how is the propagating organization.
            
            
               Semantics
            
            
               All of which brings us, inevitably, to the brink of semantics.
            
            
               It is simple at its roots, you see.
               An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is (i) food; (ii) poison; (iii) a signal; (iv) neutral; (v) something else.
            
            
               Once there is an autonomous agent, there is a semantics from its privileged point of view.
               The incoming molecule is "yuck" or "yum."
               I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent.
               And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind.
               If yum, then there will probably be more of this type of agent, osprings of the first.
               If yuck, it is not so likely this lineage will prosper.
            
            
               Once yuck and yum, we are not far from C. S. Pierce's meaning-laden semiotic triad: sign, signified, significans.
               Like it or not, the glucose gradient is a sign, a predictor, of "more glucose that way."
               Granted, the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol, any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain.
               In this restricted sense, signs are causally correlated with that which is signified.
               By contrast, the relation between the word "chair" and that which it signifies, and on which I am now sitting, is arbitrary.
               But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view?
               If so, can "mere chemicals" be signs in the full Piercean sense?
            
            
               I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words.
               Consider first the famous genetic code.
               Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein.
               The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached, the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids, the binding of the charged transfer RNA's anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet, the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm, tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is "translated."
            
            
               The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules, which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid.
               As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site, the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis.
               The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site.
               Because of this, which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging, plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA.
               Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon-codon matching mechanism.
               In short, chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations.
            
            
               It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign, signified, and significans to the genetic code.
               It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling, chemical and otherwise, within and between autonomous agents, as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that "warns" other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites.
            
            
               The calculus that is Claude Shannon's elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols.
               Nowhere in the core of Shannon's work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning, or semantics, of the information enter.
               This is no criticism, and is widely known and appreciated.
               There is, however, just a hint of semantics in Shannon's view that the semantics resides in the "decoder."
            
            
               I cannot buy Shannon's view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent.
               If not, then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of water-filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways.
               The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding.
            
            
               But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics.
               If only the bacterium could tell us: "Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me?
               I've run into that one before!
               I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me.
               I made it home.
               Pass me some more glucose please, Martha."
            
            
               I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories, for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and, therefore, cannot deduce that which will unfold.
               Thus, among other things, we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds.
               Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing.
               I too know the risks, including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from "intentional talk" to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question.
               But patience.
               Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold, but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk, let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound-wave forms monitored and masses at space-time lines as a description.
            
            
               Then let's just be naive for the moment.
               The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay, an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied know-how of that agent in making a living, or failing to make a living, in its world.
               The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered, context-dependent set of causal implications of the event, or signal, in question.
            
            
               "For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of the shoe, the horse was lost; and for want of the horse, the rider was lost," more or less, said Benjamin Franklin.
               The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context-dependent set of implications of the event, or signal, in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system.
            
            
               It seems hard to ascribe purpose, in the sense of acting on its own behalf, to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga.
               Of course, there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological.
               After all, I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment, defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf, then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf.
               Now, five chapters later, it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter, energy, and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf.
               My definition is a definitional circle.
            
            
               On the other hand, while the definition is circular, like F = MA and Darwin's "natural selection" and "fitness," that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world.
               Stones and chairs are not, by my definition, autonomous agents.
               All living cells are.
               And the stunning fact directly before us, every day, is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf.
               Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest.
            
            
               In short, once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum, it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere.
            
            
               Knowing
            
            
               What about "knowing"?
            
            
               Daniel Dennett, in his fine book Darwin's Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of "knowing," if I may use that term, that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means.
               I find his hierarchy congenial and informative.
               Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher-order entities via variation and natural selection.
            
            
               I do not disagree, although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self-organization in evolution.
               Here, in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy, detect those sources of energy, create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy, and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further.
               I wonder, in short, at the naturalness and self-generaticity of Dennett's cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres, perhaps planetary geologies, and beyond.
            
            
               But back to the past.
               Dennett distinguishes "Darwinian creatures," "Pavlovian creatures," "Popperian creatures," and "Gregorian creatures."
               A simple autonomous agent, say, a bacterium, is a Darwinian creature.
               In its simplest version, the creature evolves by mutation, also recombination and natural selection.
               For the moment, no behavioral learning is to be considered.
               So one (or a colony or an ecosystem) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us.
            
            
               At the next level up, say, aplysia, a nervous system is present, and the creature is capable of stimulus-response learning, á la Pavlov.
               Indeed, aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in "expectation" of food.
            
            
               At the next level (Dennett, perhaps properly, reserves this for us vertebrates) is the Popperian creature.
               Popperian creatures, in Dennett's fine phrase, have "internal models" of their world and can "run the internal model" with the clutch disengaged, rather than running the model in real time in the real world.
               This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our "hypotheses to die in our stead."
               I love that image.
            
            
               Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely, at least humans.
               Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives, arrows, digging sticks, machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes.
               This enlarged shared world gives us more know-how, and more know that.
               Cultural evolution, at some point, begins to burst out-of-bounds.
               Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran.
               Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom?
               Chinese cooking lands in Cuba, and Cuban-Chinese cuisine is invented.
               What's next under the sun?
               Who can say?
            
            
               I very much like Dennett's ladder of know-how, and eventual know that.
               Without invoking consciousness, not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject, it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems, even without evoking nerve cells.
            
            
               I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations.
               For example, bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already, for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level.
               This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter.
               As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus, why not envision a complex chemistry, say, very complex carbohydrate-synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves, which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism.
               Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self-sustaining web linking the carbohydrates, the enzymes, and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus, then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops.
               The image is not too far from how it is imagined that "idiotype" and "anti-idiotype" immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen.
               In such networks, for which there is modestly good evidence, a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences, called the "idiotype" of the first antibody.
               In turn, the second "anti-idiotype" antibody stimulates a third, which stimulates a fourth.
               But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody, hence, the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space.
               It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system.
            
            
               Popperian creatures?
               Why cannot the molecular-sensing and hypothesis-testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor, or not, such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by?
               Are nerves necessary?
               Plants, as noted, are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade.
               There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect, just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified.
               Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates.
            
            
               I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures.
               Even here, the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language, wherever new sentences can be created, is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole.
               If the conversation we recent two-legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive, so too is the chemical conversation in any full-fledged ecosystem, where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another.
            
            
               I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere, with its urgent diversity in which, emboldened by all our know-how, we do get on with a very rich conversation, may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks.
               We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail, I guess.
               Smart place, a biosphere, lots to talk about.

               Ethics
            
            
               And what of ethics?
               Does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents?
               Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent.
               There are deep reasons for caution.
               Hume told us long ago about the "naturalistic fallacy": One cannot deduce "ought" from "is."
               From the fact that mothers care for their young, we cannot deduce that they ought to do so, Hume argued.
               From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry, we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so.
            
            
               Indeed, Hume's injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements.
               We scientists find the facts.
               You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics.
               But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is, where do values come from at all?
               Hume's injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category "ought."
            
            
               The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long, twisted, arduous.
               Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful, philosophers as famous as G. E. Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances.
               "It is wrong to kill."
               Becomes, "Agggah!"
               Does the positivist argument seem persuasive?
               It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists, "only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful," is itself not empirically verifiable.
               One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards.
            
            
               John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all "contractually" agree to, were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments.
               Thus "equality before the law" is one contract that Rawls commends to us.
               "Equality before the law" is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium.
               The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue.
            
            
               I will content myself with wondering where "value" and the rudiments of "intentionality" come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts.
               Where is the place of value in a world of fact?
            
            
               So, a short soliloquy.
               Facts are know-that statements.
               But know-how preceded know that.
               While fully aware of Hume's injunction, I think that from the autonomous agent's perspective, yuck or yum is primary, unavoidable, and of the deepest importance to that agent.
               I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria.
               Too much yuck, this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere.
               Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future, I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around.
            
            
               And again without attributing consciousness, once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present?
               If so, another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid.
               Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible.
               You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control.
               To act ethically, you must first be able to act at all.
            
            
               But what are "acts" in the first place?
               Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician.
               Now entering Harvard, Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive, after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard, where, at age fourteen, Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands.
               Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the "doings" of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent.
               Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner.
               But all sorts of molecular vibrational, rotational, and translational motions are occurring.
               What are actions and what are mere happenings?
            
            
               I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics.
               But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings, Dan's happy phrasing, is relevant for E. coli , tigers, us, trees, and autonomous agents in general.
               We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism.
            
            
               Strange and interesting, is it not, that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise?
               Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier, yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics, intentionality, value, and ethics arise with autonomous agents.
               I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume's naturalistic fallacy.
               We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context, but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents.
    



Deformation and river response 

Before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed, a brief review of types of tectonic activity, types of rivers, and river response will be presented. This background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow. 

Types of deformation

The surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. The displacement can be seismic and associated with earthquakes and abrupt faulting, or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor. Faults may be lateral faults that displace or offset the channel (Figure 2.1A) without vertical displacement. This type of displacement should be easily recognized. Faults with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened (Figure 2.1B). In the opposite case, the gradient will be decreased (Figure 2.1C). The effect will resemble monoclinal tilting (Figure 2.1F, G). Pairs of faults may produce uplifted (horst) or downdropped blocks (graben) that will both steepen and reduce gradient (Figure 2.1D, E). This has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines (Figure 2.1H, I). 

In addition to all of these structural features, the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain (Figure 2.1J, K, L). The possibilities are great, but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or cross-valley tilting. 

Streams respond to vertical displacement along faults (Figure 2.1B and C) by aggradation or degradation. When the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient (Figure 2.1B), erosion will be initiated in this reach. When the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream (Figure 2.1C), aggradation will occur. Even small displacements may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large streams. If the displacement forms a dam (Figure 2.1C), the stream will be blocked, and it will flow along the fault or form a lake. Wallace (1968) mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream, which can divert its course.

Figure 2.1 Surface deformation by faulting, folding, and lateral tilting. Plan view on left; cross-section on right (from Ouchi, 1983) small arrows indicate direction of flow. Large arrows indicate direction of movement. The displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated. 

Horst and graben (Figure 2.1D and E) combine two different types of vertical displacement (Figure 2.1B and C). There will be aggradation upstream from the horst, and degradation, which will migrate upstream, on the downstream part of the horst. Reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation. Upstream of the graben, there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself. A river in such a location will be unstable, as Cartier and Alt (1982) suggested for the Bitterroot River in Montana. 

The type of folding (Figure 2.1) will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting, but changes will probably be less abrupt. The effects of tilting will depend upon the amount, but in the simplest case, steepening of a valley will cause degradation (Figure 2.1K) and a reverse tilt (Figure 2.1L) will cause deposition. Lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip (Figure 2.1J) or avulsion. 

Figure 2.1 shows only simple, but exaggerated cases, whereas actual displacements can be more complicated. For example, faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction. Fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious, and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed. For example, small stream channels have been offset by strike-slip movement (Figures 1.8, 2.1A) of the San Andreas fault. Wallace (1968) pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes. The main reason why channel offset caused by the San Andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault (20.3 mm/year, Brown and Wallace, 1968) and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault. While fault displacements are obvious, movements of the land surface by folding can be slow. However, this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior. For example, concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt (Jefferson, 1907; Nanson, 1980a; Leeder and Alexander, 1987). 

Types of alluvial rivers

It is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation; therefore, their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated. This can best be done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern. 

Five basic channel patterns exist (Figure 2.2): (1) straight channels with either migrating sand waves; or (2) with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg; (3) two types of meandering channels, a highly sinuous channel of equal width (pattern 3a) and channels that are wider at bends than in crossings (pattern 3b); (4) the meandering–braided transition; and (5) a typical braided stream. The relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels, as related to relative sediment size, load, velocity of flow, and stream power, are also indicated in Figure 2.2. It has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient, sediment load, stream power, and the type of sediment load transported by the channel (Schumm and Kahn, 1972). Therefore, alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels, as suspended-load, mixed-load, and bed-load channels (Figure 2.2). Water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel (width, depth, meander dimensions), but the relative proportions of bed load (sand and gravel) and suspended load (silts and clays) determine not only the shape of the channel but width–depth ratio and channel pattern. A suspended-load channel has been defined as one that transports less than 3 percent bed load and a bed-load channel as one transporting more than 11 percent bed load (Schumm, 1977). The mixed-load channel lies between these two (Figure 2.2). 

NULL

Figure 2.2 Channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated (Schumm, 1981). 

Alluvial rivers that transport clay, silt, sand, and gravel, can be placed within these three general categories. However, within the meandering-stream group there is considerable range of sinuosity (1.25 to 3.0). In addition, in the braided-stream category, there are bar-braided and island-braided channels (islands are vegetated bars). 

Figure 2.2 suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum, but experimental work and field studies have indicated that the changes of pattern between braided, meandering, and straight, occur relatively abruptly at river-pattern thresholds (Figure 2.3). The pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power, gradient, and sediment load (Schumm and Kahn, 1972). 

NULL

Figure 2.3 Relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge. Sediment load, stream power, velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables (from Schumm and Khan, 1972). 

Although the five patterns of Figure 2.2 involve all three river types, there are five basic bed-load channel patterns (Figure 2.4A) that have been recognized during experimental studies of channel patterns (Schumm, 1977, p. 158). These five basic bed-load channel patterns can be extended to mixed-load and suspended-load channels to produce 13 river patterns (Figure 2.4). Patterns 1–5 are bed-load channel patterns, patterns 6–10 are mixed-load channel patterns, and patterns 11–13 are suspended-load channel patterns. Figure 2.4 attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope, stream power and sediment load for each channel type. The three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load, but within each type, the different patterns reflect increased valley slope, sediment load, and stream power. 

The different bed-load channel patterns (Figure 2.4) can be described as follows: Pattern 1, straight, essentially equal-width channel with migrating sand waves. Pattern 2, alternate-bar channel with migrating side or alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg; Pattern 3, low-sinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes; Pattern 4, transitional meandering-thalweg braided channel. The large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes, but a meandering thalweg can be identified. Pattern 5 is a typical bar-braided channel. 

As compared to the bed-load channels, the five mixed-load channels (Figure 2.4B) are relatively narrower and deeper, and there is greater bank stability. The higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow, deep, straight channels (Pattern 6), and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels (Pattern 7). Pattern 8 is a truly meandering channel, wide on the bends, relatively narrow at the crossings, and subject to chute cutoffs. Pattern 9 maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel, but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuous-braided appearance. Pattern 10 is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bed-load channel 5, and it is likely to be island-braided. 

NULL

Figure 2.4 The range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types: (A) bed-load channel patterns, (B) mixed-load channel patterns, (C) suspended-load channel patterns (from Schumm, 1981). 


Suspended-load channels (Figure 2.4C) are narrow and deeper than mixed-load channels. Suspended load Pattern 11 is a straight, narrow, deep channel. With only small quantities of bed load, this type of channel may have the highest sinuosity of all (Patterns 12 and 13). 

Rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely. That is, a suspended-load channel (Pattern 12) could become braided (Pattern 5), or a braided channel (Pattern 5) could become meandering (Pattern 8 or 12), etc., when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel. Therefore, the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common, as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions, or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics. 

There is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of Figure 2.4. This is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments (Schumm et al., 1996). The channel segments can be straight, meandering, or braided, and they appear to span the range of channel types. Anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain (Figure 2.5), whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel. Knighton and Nanson (1993) and Richards et al. (1993) suggest that this pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys (Smith and Smith, 1980) and tectonic uplift (Gregory and Schumm, 1987). Reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important, and therefore, anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity. 

Evidence of deformation 

The first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from long-continued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces. These obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers. 

Drainage networks

The arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops, climate, and the erodibility of the surface material. Local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern (Figure 1.2). For example, experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 2.5 percent, whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes (Phillips and Schumm, 1987). 

NULL

Local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns. A topographic high caused by active uplift, will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern. For instance, on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope. This can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network. An uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope (Figure 2.6). As the major streams are deflected away from the uplift, tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened. 

Changes of an entire drainage network, as a result of tilting, are described by Sparling (1967) who notes that isostatic adjustment in Ottawa County, Ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others. Incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient. Russell (1939) described various drainage patterns found in the flat alluvial lands of Louisiana, and he recognized a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern, as a result of tilting and steepening of the gradient.

Figure 2.6 Drainage pattern modified by uplift. 

Price and Whetstone (1977) used asymmetric river and valley cross-section profiles, as evidence for movement along the Chattahoochee Embayment in Florida. Subsidence caused southward migration of east–west flowing channels. South-flowing streams exhibit paired terraces while east–west trending streams contain extensive terraces on the northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin. Subsidence in the Chattahoochee Embayment and adjacent warping along the Chattahoochee Uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the Chattahoochee River. 

Long-continued tilting in a cross-valley direction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network. Muehlberger (1979) noted this type of asymmetry in an area near Taos, New Mexico (Figure 2.7). Using 71⁄minute U.S. Geological Survey topographic

2 maps, he described this asymmetry quantitatively. By selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to this contour in a down-tilt direction (Dd) and in the opposite, uptilt direction (Du) an index of asymmetry was developed (Dd/Du) (Figure 2.7). The index for 30 small drainage basins was 0.6 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a down-tilt direction. Cox (1994) used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern Mississippi Embayment. Other indices of asymmetry are described by Keller and Pinter (1996, pp. 126, 127).

Lake patterns

Lakes are temporary features in terms of geological time, but they can be clear evidence of deformation. They occur at various scales, along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network, and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time. They may be isolated, but they are more frequently clustered in a specific area, or they are aligned along specific trends. Isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses, which form a dam, but clustered lakes are due to regional processes, which may be related to climate (or paleoclimate), neotectonic deformation, or frequently a combination of these processes. 

Large lakes may occupy geological basins, and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation. Such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations. The Bolivian Altiplano lakes (Titicaca, Popoo, Uyuni) stand at an elevation of around 4000 m and are associated with plate convergence and uplift. Continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes. Often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious, and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics. (See Chapter 5 where Reelfoot Lake and the Mississippi valley sunklands are described; Figures 5.1, 5.2).

This discussion deals with cases where specific lake patterns, (ria lakes and elongated lakes), are related to active deformation. Most of these concepts are not new. For example, the significance of ria lakes was identified more than 30 years ago. 

Ria Lakes 

Dendritic ria lakes occur at the lower part of a tributary, which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river (Holz et al., 1979). In the lower and central parts of the Amazonian Basin the formation of ria lakes is related to post-glacial eustacy (Irion, 1984). Some of these lakes have a “knee” pattern superposed on the dendritic pattern suggesting the effect of active faulting through a thick sedimentary cover (Sternberg, 1950, 1955, Figure 2.8).

Section along X–Y in the lower part of the figure, modified after Laurent (1985). 

Reservoirs behind dams take the form of ria lakes. Clusters of ria lakes are observed along large rivers in the western Marañón Basin and in the central Ucayali Basin, Peru (Räsänen et al., 1987; Dumont, 1993). They are related to active subsidence of the back side of piggy back or thrust faults. Similar patterns are observed on the south margin of the Beni Basin (Dumont, 1992; Dumont and Guyot, 1993). 

An elongated cluster of ria lakes is located along the lower Pastaza River and the Marañón River in the western part of the Marañón Basin (Figure 2.9). This cluster is superimposed over the structural axis of the basin, which trends toward the Ucamara Depression. This axis of maximum subsidence of the basin is located in front of the Subandean Thrust and Fault Belt (STFB).

The Pastaza depression is filled by more than 4 500 m of Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments, with about 500 m of Quaternary sediment (Laurent, 1985) (Figure 2.9). No ria lakes are observed in the south part of the Marañón Basin (Ucamara Depression), but ria lakes occur again in the Ucayali Basin of Central Peru (Figure 2.10), a piggy-back basin. 

A continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earth’s surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers. For example, Lake Victoria is drained by the Victoria Nile which flows north to Lake Kyoga (Figure 2.11). Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwania look artificial, but they are not the result of dam construction. They are, in fact, formed by uplift and eastward tilting of western Uganda. Flow in the Kafu River has been reversed, and water draining from Lake Victoria has found a new course to the north, where it flows over Murchison Falls and into Lake Albert. The geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time (Doornkamp and Temple, 1966).

Elongated lakes 

The term elongated lakes is applied to lakes that are long and narrow. These lakes are superimposed over basement structures. In subsiding basins, they are also closely related to active tectonics. 

The Puinahua (1324 km2) and Punga (341 km2) lakes are both located in the south part of the Marañón Basin (Figure 2.10). They are long and narrow and wider on the foothill side than on the craton side. Punga Lake is superimposed over the structure of the Santa Elena uplift (Dumont and Garcia, 1991), which is interpreted as a crystalline horst surrounded by Paleozoic sedimentary strata (Laurent, 1985). The NE elongation of the lake is parallel to a few of the structural features mentioned by Laurent (1985). Both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a NNW–SSE extension in the upland border (Dumont et al., 1988). As a result, the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of Andean tectonics (Dumont and Garcia, 1991). 

More precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the Punga Lake. According to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals (Stiglish, 1904) the area was covered by forest, that developed on a terrace before 1923. Then the region began to subside. The tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible, now below 2 m of water during low water stages. In this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods, suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years. A tectonic interpretation is favored because a local rise of base level cannot be involved. Only a downward motion of the area where the lake is observed can explain the phenomenon. These lakes are related to downdropped blocks that are related to a tensional system. 

Terraces

The vertical warping of terraces, as a result of deformation, has been studied by numerous investigators (Machida, 1960; Zuchiewicz, 1980; King and Stein, 1983). The offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement. The offset terraces at the mouth of the Waiohine Gorge in New Zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement (Figure 2.12). In addition to river terraces, the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces (Keller and Pinter, 1996) are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally at a given water level. An example is the isostatic deformation of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville shorelines, Utah (Crittenden, 1963). Portions of the Lake Bonneville shorelines have been deformed as much as 210 feet, as it drained and evaporated to form Great Salt Lake. In addition, deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the Pacific Coast of Baja, California (Orme, 1980). Not only are terraces deformed, but as an uplift is crossed, a floodplain can be converted to a low terrace. This will, of course, dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach. 

In addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above, evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial deposits and paleosoils (Machette, 1978; Keller et al., 1982; Bull, 1984; Rockwell et al., 1984; Rockwell, 1988) by variations in gradients of streams of different orders (Merritts and Vincent, 1989; Merritts and Hesterberg, 1994) and by variations of valley and river longitudinal profiles (Volkov et al., 1967; Seeber and Gornitz, 1983).

The length of the fault shown on the diagram is about 0.8 km (1/2 mile) (modified after Stevens, 1974). 

River response 

The clearest evidence for tectonic effects on rivers are anomalous reaches that show dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes. Structural geologists and petroleum geologists have known for years that rivers are strong indicators of faulting (Lattman, 1959; Howard, 1967). 

Tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior, and this is especially true of alluvial rivers. Neef (1966) and Radulescu (1962) state that neotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope, such as meander characteristics. In addition, the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley. Clearly, one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream (Bendefy et al., 1967; Zuchiewicz, 1979). 

Alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change. In order to maintain a constant gradient, a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid, whereas a reduction of valley slope will lead to a reduction of sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change. For example, Twidale (1966) reported that both the Flinders and Leichardt Rivers have changed to a braided pattern, as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the Selwyn Upwarp in northern Queensland, Australia; and the Red River near Winnipeg, Canada is straightening, as a result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound (Welch, 1973). Other examples are provided by the Mississippi River between St. Louis and Cairo and the lower Missouri River (Adams, 1980) as well as the Red River of the North near Winnipeg, Canada (Vanicek and Nagy, 1980). 

Baselevel changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics, and can provide information on channel change. For example, if sea-level is lowered, and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed, the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift. Lane (1955) argued that a lowering of baselevel will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river. Indeed, Lane’s (1955) argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade, then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel, the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished. However, sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation. Another fallacy in Lane’s argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical. This is not the case, and the two-dimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions. For example, a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor. 

Sinuosity (P) is the ratio between channel length (L c) and valley length (L v), and it is also the ratio between valley slope (S v) and channel gradient (S c) as follows: 



Therefore, a straight channel has a sinuosity of 1.0, and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same. It has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes (Schumm, 1968), and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the Mississippi, Indus, and Nile, reflect the variability of the valley slope (Schumm et al., 1994; Jorgensen et al., 1993; Schumm and Galay, 1994).

Figure 2.13 Effect of a baselevel fall on channel length and pattern. See text for discussion. 

Figure 2.13 illustrates this concept geometrically, and it shows the impact of the lowering of baselevel in a valley with a stream of sinuosity (P) 1.5. The line A–C represents the channel profile, and the line A–B represents the profile of the valley floor. Points B and C are at the river mouth, and points F and G are at the same location in the valley. The channel distance is one-third longer than the valley distance, and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream. The length of the channel is 1.5 times the length of the valley and, therefore, the stream gradient is one-third less than the valley slope (equation 1). If a vertical fall of baselevel from B to D and C to E is assumed, channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor. If the channel is not confined laterally, it can adjust to the increased valley slope (F–D) by increasing sinuosity to 2.0, and the channel profile is extended to H. In this case, incision ceases at point F in the valley and at point G in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 1.5 to 2.0 from G to H maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope (F–D). The one-third increase of channel length (sinuosity) between G and H compensates for a one-third steepening of the valley floor from F to D. 

According to Lane’s assumptions, the effect of this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point A, where an amount of erosion equal to B–D would occur. However, because the stream can adjust, the steepening of the valley floor will not result in a change of stream gradient. Rather the channel lengthens, and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream. The distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor, but this exercise supports Saucier’s (1991) contention that Pleistocene sea level change in the lower Mississippi valley was effective only as far as Baton Rouge (see also Blum, 1993 and Blum and Valastro, 1994). The probability that a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly, unlike during the experimental studies. The river, therefore, has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity. 

Further evidence for the type of channel response shown in Figure 2.13 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of Jeff Ware (1992 oral comm.). He lowered baselevel relatively slowly to a maximum of 12 cm in a flume with a total length of 18.4 m. This change would have doubled the channel gradient. However, the effect of the baselevel lowering extended only 4 m upstream, and the change in baselevel was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from 1.2 to 1.5 in the lower 4 m in the flume. It is clear, however, that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel. This channel widened and roughness increased, thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baselevel change. 

Ware’s experiments showed that a sinuosity increase, which resulted in a slope decrease, was only part of the adjustment, and width, depth, and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power. Therefore, channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baselevel change. The River Nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes (Schumm and Galay, 1994). 

Changes of valley-floor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations, but variations of valley-floor slope can be the result of several influences. Tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern (Adams, 1980). In addition, a high-sediment-transporting tributary may build a fan-like deposit in the valley, which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased. When the main river crosses this fan, pattern changes will result, as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient. Tributaries to the Jordan River in Israel have developed fan-like deposits in the valley, and the valley floor of the Jordan Valley undulates as a result. The Jordan River, as it approaches one of these convexities, straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan (Schumm, 1977, p. 140). 

It is important to realize that channels that lie near a pattern threshold (Figure 2.3) may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable. For example, some rivers that are meandering and that are near pattern thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load (Schumm, 1979). Experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valley-floor slope will cause a change of channel morphology. The change will differ, however, depending where the channel lies on a plot such as that of Figure 2.3 and depending on the type of channel (Figure 2.4). For example, with increasing slope, a straight channel will become sinuous, a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous, and a meandering channel will braid. With decreasing slope, a braided channel will meander and a meandering channel will straighten.

Figure 2.14 Reaches of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting. 

Although pattern changes may dominate river response, deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient (Figure 2.14). In fact, upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion. Therefore, in addition to the primary valley-floor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation, there are third-order effects beyond the area of deformation. For example, deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation (Figure 2.14). This means that the uplift is acting as a dam, and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate, erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation. However, it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach, and when this increased load moves downstream, aggradation will result (Figure 2.14).

Figure 2.15 Effect of change from weaker (W) to more resistant (R) materials on meander pattern. 

Another aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades. Resistant alluvium (clay plugs, gravel armor) or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion. The result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact. For example, as meanders shift downvalley, their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered (Jin and Schumm, 1987). Hence, a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed (Figure 2.15). A similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upwarp or if, as a result of incision, it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course. Yeromenko and Ivanov (1977) reviewed the Russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts, the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures, which supports Gardner’s (1975) observations of bedrock channels in the Colorado Plateau. This is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of Figure 2.3. Therefore, an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone. 

Discussion

Alluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology, but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology and behavior of alluvial rivers. Rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even, slow, aseismic tectonic activity. For example, evidence of active tectonics is as follows: 


	1.
	deformation of valley floor longitudinal profile
	2.
	deformation of channel longitudinal profile
	3.
	change of channel pattern 
	4.
	change of channel width and depth
	5.
	conversion of floodplain to a low terrace
	6.
	reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift 
	7.
	effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation (degradation, aggradation, flooding, bank erosion)
	8.
	formation of lakes 


Alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change, but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics. Therefore, it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when, in fact, human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time. Pattern change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics, rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence and/or surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation. In many areas, the evidence will be circumstantial. Nevertheless, anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls, tributary influences, lithologic change, or paleotectonics may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise. 

Lakes can also provide information on subsidence, and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences. For example, during Pleistocene aggradation in the Ohio River and Mississippi River valleys, numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys. Therefore, care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies. 



        
  



7 The future of boundaryless careers



When massive economic restructuring forced William H. Whyte Jr’s (1956) ‘organization man’ to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation, many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind. In the wake of his departure, people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life, a corporate ‘road map’ to guide their destiny and the firm’s hierarchy to define their status or place in society. Without employers’ orderly structures, external guides for action, and linear career paths, however, just what is the future of career? When ‘the career’ devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of ‘career anarchy’ result? Is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing? 

We argue here that the answer is an emphatic ‘yes’. The new environment suggests a shift from pre-ordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities. As a result a shift from ‘bounded’ careers – prescribed by relatively stable organisational and occupational structures – to ‘boundaryless’ careers – where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day – is increasingly common. The concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based, and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change. It does not characterise any single career form, but rather ‘a range of possible forms that defy traditional employment assumptions’ (Arthur & Rousseau, 1996, p. 6). 

The myriad interactions of a boundaryless career over a lifetime of work experiences can appear overwhelming. A complex web of relationships emerges from numerous exchanges among individuals, teams, and employers. The interplay may seem downright chaotic. So much so, that one may be tempted to think that no aggregates can be drawn from this seemingly random micro-level behaviour. Yet, despite the large amount of publicity generated as ‘organization man’ was shown to the door, a large proportion of people who participate in the work place, and even whole industries, never really played by the traditional rules anyway. For these people and industries the ‘boundaryless career’ is simply business as usual. It is business to which we can turn to understand better the future of career or – as we see the future – the boundaryless career. 

We focus in this chapter on situations where boundaryless career practices appear to be well established and fruitful, involving industries where open labour markets have thrived. Our examination suggests that seemingly random micro-level activities result in the creation of emergent pattern and order. Further examination reveals not only order, but remarkable stability. In the absence of external guides, people selforganise to learn and make sense of their environments. Moreover, the resulting social interdependence provides a new form of cohesiveness that, in turn, introduces new structure. Micro-level activities gather the force and the power to shape macro-level processes and larger institutions. It is organising, rather than organisation, that is the catch-word of the boundaryless career. 

In this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of boundaryless careers. We present a theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of boundaryless careers followed by descriptive analysis demonstrating evidence of theory in practice in two selected industries. First we present relevant aspects of Karl Weick’s work (1979, 1995, and 1996) and discuss the process of ‘enactment’. We then examine the industry cases. We conclude by refining the arguments by noting key behavioural aspects of enactment and other considerations of the process. 

An enactment perspective 

Our exploration in this chapter is framed in the social–psychological perspective of Karl Weick (1996). Weick’s work provides a theoretical lens for explaining the processes at work in boundaryless career behaviour. His conception of enactment, directly related to his previous (1995) work on sensemaking, explains the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that operates in boundaryless careers. The enactment view emphasises that action creates the environment. That is, people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds. A simple analogy is with the legal system. People enact laws, which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour, leading people to enact new laws, and so on. A legal system continually evolves from the enactment of individual laws. Similarly, career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers. 

Another way to engage with enactment is to relate it to the process of natural selection. According to Weick (1996), careers unfold through successive cycles of enactment, selection, and retention, whereby the enactment of careers gives rise to broader organising of work arrangements. From this standpoint, the ‘basic theme for the entire organizing model is found in the following recipe for sensemaking: ‘‘How can I know what I think until I see what I say?’’ ’ (Weick, 1979, p. 133). In the simplest form of the recipe, enactment is ‘saying’ (action), selection is ‘seeing what I say’ (perception), and retention is ‘knowing what I think’ (sensemaking). 

If enactment is ‘saying’ then it is, in essence, the action of individuals in their environment that starts the process. When someone takes action, or interacts with their environment, it immediately impacts others and hence the individual produces part of their environment. For example, if you believe a certain group of individuals to be hostile, when you interact with them your behaviour may reflect your fear. In response they may sense that fear and behave in a hostile manner. The environment becomes hostile. Moreover, you have contributed to ‘enacting’ that hostile environment. The result is a circular self-reinforcing relationship resembling a self-fulfilling prophecy. An alternative, perhaps more satisfactory circular relationship could result if, instead of fear, you initially showed confidence. 

How do we relate this process to boundaryless careers? For this, it is important to understand that there is less room for personal inputs, manoeuvring, or ‘enactment’ if there are clear salient rules and structures defining behaviour. In traditional bounded organisations and careers the proliferation of structure, hierarchy, plans, detailed job descriptions, prescribed relationships, and established ‘road maps’ provide an armoury of articulated rules and social cues to guide behaviour. The situation is ‘strong’ (Mischel, 1968) in as much as it provides little scope for improvisation. 

In the pure form of the boundaryless career, however, such explicit guides do not exist. Instead of providing clear guidelines, employment situations are characterised by ambiguity. ‘Weak’ situations fall short of providing sufficient incentives for consistent behaviour or even similar expectations for those operating within them (Mischel, 1968). In ‘weak’ situations individuals are not able to interpret events in the same way, and the resulting ambiguity opens the door to myriad personal interpretations and opportunities for enactment. People engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system (Weick, 1979). People join together in shared improvisation that begins to form new codes and structures to guide their further behaviour. In the process ‘microstrength shapes macroweaknesses’ (Weick, 1996, p. 44) through the unfolding of boundaryless careers. 

To illustrate the preceding argument we will apply Weick’s ideas to descriptions provided by AnnaLee Saxenian (1996) on the dynamics of the Silicon Valley and by Candace Jones (1996) on the independent film industry. We reinterpret the contributions of these authors by explicitly re-framing them within Weick’s framework (and we emphasise it is these three authors, and their original descriptions and ideas, that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter). 

To show how enactment and associated principles of self-organising and learning come to life, we will trace the process of enactment in each setting. First, we will describe the factors that have contributed to boundaryless career forms in each example. Next, we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances ‘weak’. After that we will discuss the social behaviour and collective actions that fill the resulting void in the environment. Finally, we will point out the patterns, order, and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings. By doing so we hope to convey the pervasive qualities of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it operates – the boundaryless career. 

The Silicon Valley 

The Silicon Valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms. So much so that the name ‘Silicon Valley’ has come to be synonymous with the electronics industry. The region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the world’s most influential firms, including Apple, Hewlett Packard, and Intel. Since its inception the Valley has operated with an individualistic open labour market. Today, the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region (Saxenian, 1996). One can argue that the Valley’s ‘boundarylessness’ is a necessary feature of operating in a dynamic industry that demands constant innovation. Proponents point out that, in order to learn and solve the problems encountered in rapid technological advancement, knowledge must be shared among firms in a symbiotic balance between co-operation and competition. Boundaryless characteristics appear more prominently when an industry is knowledge – rather than capital-intensive or when firms operate in economic clusters. 

However, other industry clusters and several notable large electronics firms do not engage with boundaryless practices. We may, therefore, attribute the ‘boundaryless’ features of the Silicon Valley to its heritage. Some believe this is in part due to the location of the region, hosting a ‘West Coast’ Northern Californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established ‘East Coast’ industry. The greenfield site had an empty slate and no institutional rules. Others, like the late William Hewlett, a key and highly influential founder of the region, believe that success stemmed from the learning advantages of an open labour market. Hewlett ‘routinely offered the following advice . . . ‘‘If you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three things: change jobs often, talk to your competitors and take risks – even if it means failing’’ ’ (Saxenian, 1996, p. 23). Hewlett was himself influenced by his Stanford Dean of Engineering William Terman, a mentor and an influential Hewlett Packard board member (Collins & Porras, 1995). Today, Hewlett’s and Terman’s philosophy permeates the region. Despite fierce inter-firm competition, open information exchange is common practice among the region’s producers. 

Several features of the Valley contribute to creating a ‘weak’ environment. The high pace of technology and product life cycles, fluidity of firm formation and failure, rapid employee turnover resulting in little com-pany-specific socialisation, as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy, all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour. For example, in the Valley, technology moves quickly and competition is tough. New firms form almost overnight -and many disappear just as quickly. When firms come and go like ships in the night it is not surprising that employees tend to identify with their profession, not their company. Moreover, people’s loyalty is not only to their profession, but to the host industry region. ‘As one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted: ‘‘Many of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for Silicon Valley Inc.’’ ’ (Saxenian, 1996, p. 23). They view job-changing as the norm. 

Average job tenure is in the area of two years, and annual turnover is around 35%, and often higher for smaller firms (Saxenian, 1996). As one engineer explained: ‘two or three years is about the max [at a job] for the Valley because there’s always something more interesting across the street’ (Saxenian, p. 28). Knowledge and practices cross company borders at a pace that defies the embedding of ‘routines’ within the boundaries of any single company, and instead favours inter-company exchange. Everyone knows that, upon leaving a company, they may well work together again in the future: ‘A colleague might become a customer or a competitor; today’s boss could be tomorrow’s subordinate’ (Saxenian, p. 29). Institutionally based hierarchy, therefore, loses its saliency. In the Valley, respect and authority are gained through competence, technical excellence, and market share, with the highest regard accorded to successful entrepreneurs. 

In the context of this ‘weak’ environment, clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the micro-level. People seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings. In the Valley, information is the life-blood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career. People build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community. Learning takes place in the pub or club. In the Valley’s early days, it used to take place in the infamous Wagon Wheel Bar and the Homebrew Computer Club. Now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the Valley’s high-technology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work. In these meeting places, people gather to see old friends, gossip, and make new acquaintances. In the workers’ adopted social settings, the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally. 

In the Silicon Valley, collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests, intellectual curiosity, and problem solving geared towards developing new markets, technologies, products, or applications for computers. Workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field. As one engineer explained, the process is quite simple: ‘people rub shoulders and share ideas’ (Saxenian, p. 27). The knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many ‘local entrepreneurs came to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business’ (Saxenian, p. 26) As one local manager claimed: ‘‘‘Over a lunch conversation or a beer, you’ll learn that company A or company B has a technology you want . . . If it fits your needs, you’ll build it into your next product’’’ (Saxenian, p. 31). In this manner, micro-level conversations influence the creation of new technologies, products, and applications. 

It is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the Valley. In the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning, employees in the Valley rely on their skills, rather than on formal position, to provide a reference point for their careers. Such self-generated guides are reinforced by professional social networks, which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry. These networks serve as efficient job search networks and makeshift recruitment centres. As one engineer reported: ‘‘‘You don’t just hire people out of the blue. In general, it’s people you know, or you know someone who knows them’’’ (Saxenian, p. 27). Social networks impose structure on larger and looser situations. It is the region and its relationships, rather than the firm, that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in Silicon Valley (Saxenian, 1996). 

Thus, while Silicon Valley’s high rates of job mobility and new-firm formation lead to local losses for individual firms, they also foster a dynamic process of adaptation that spurs the evolution of the region. Knowledge of the latest techniques in design, production, and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area. The result is an exceptional rate of technical and organisational innovation created by a ‘complex mix of social solidarity and individualistic competition’ (Saxenian, 1996, p. 25). The resilience of Silicon Valley’s economy shows that an unpredictable open labour market and seemingly ‘chaotic’ career paths and relationships have led to macro-economic stability for the region and hence continued opportunity for the community at large. ‘Ironically, many of these Silicon Valley job hoppers may well have led more stable lives than the upwardly mobile ‘‘organizational men’’ of the 1950s who were transferred from place to place by the same employer’ (Saxenian, p. 28). 

The independent film-making industry 

Like the Silicon Valley, the independent film-making industry is noted for its innovative ability, cutting edge creativity, and overall economic success. Like in the Silicon Valley, boundaryless careers are central to independent film-making activities. These activities evolved in the wake of fierce competition posed by the proliferation of television and the need to cut fixed costs. They superseded the former studio-based model of in-house film production, and its associated restrictive practices. Since the early 1970s, the new model has persisted. Boundaryless careers provide the building blocks that combine to facilitate production of the industry’s separately creative parts. Independent film production has thrived as a superior organising model to its in-house predecessor (Jones, 1996). 

Several characteristics of the independent film industry favour boundarylessness, including the uncertainty in the marketplace, the limited project duration, the lack of vertical integration among industry players, and the excess supply of quality labour. The uncertainty of the market stems from the fact that production of any particular film revolves around whether or not sufficient financing is obtained to start and ultimately complete production of any given film. When financing is arranged, it is specifically for the purpose of completing a single project, the making of the film. The limited duration of the project is such that all resources, including human resources, are temporary. The assembled company is essentially wound down upon the film’s release. At this time, the film’s credits symbolise that those who made it have moved on to other assignments. 

Uncertainty over financing and limited project duration foster a ‘weak’ environment in which permanent structure is dysfunctional. Studios combine with subcontractors for specific film projects and disband when the work is done. Moreover, the project-based system allows for highly complex, unique ‘products’ – films – to benefit from rapid and efficient allocation and re-allocation of resources. Each time a film is completed the whole process starts over again and employment relationships are re-negotiated. A ready supply of quality labour contributes to the success of the independent production model. The industry is a magnet for talented, committed workers eager for work on the industry’s terms. These include being ready to depart to remote locations at a moment’s notice. However, as with Silicon Valley high-technology projects, much of the work is economically ‘clustered’, thereby facilitating fluidity of movement from one challenge to another. 

As Jones’s (1996) research affirms, people’s social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry. At the ‘beginning’ stage, freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry. As one grip/electrician explained: ‘‘‘There’s no tried and true way to get started. You have to find people you like who make movies . . . It’s getting the first job that is the hardest’’’ (Jones, 1996, p. 62). Once inside, the worker at the ‘crafting’ stage finds that, ‘You build your reputation every day. You’re only as good as your last job’ (pp. 64–5). Reputation matters, as careers are self-managed and advanced through successive ‘credits’ that span multiple, largely forgotten, temporary film-making companies. 

Having learned key skills and become indoctrinated into the industry culture, individuals enter a ‘navigating’ stage, furthering their reputation and developing the personal contacts that provide the resources to navigate from one project to another. In the words of one film commissioner, ‘‘‘We are a big industry but a small industry because we talk to one another’’’ (Jones, 1996, p. 65). It is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills. Eventually, successful careers go full circle and move to a ‘maintenance’ stage. Here, senior members of the industry identify and train new members, establish workshops that develop talent in the field, and co-ordinate events such as film festivals. During this period people address personal needs which may have been neglected during earlier career stages because of the necessity to survive in a relatively unforgiving industry. 

In a ‘weak’ environment that lasts a lifetime, it is critical that non-bureaucratic forms of cohesion bring order to the industry. Part of this cohesion is provided by subcontractors, whose processes of selection, training, and socialisation bring boundaryless careers together in project-based arrangements that provide tacit infrastructure and social familiarity. However, it is at the level of the individual career that we can most clearly see the micro-level behaviour that fills the relatively structure-less context. Despite the fact that no explicit rules or operating procedures exist there is much tacit communication that binds professionals together. The aggregate effects of individuals acting independently leads to macro-level cohesion. Shared understanding and related expectations, for example regarding the need for unusual working hours and the use of ‘idle’ time to teach newcomers professional skills, play a key role linking identities to workplace interactions. In the process of learning the ropes, individuals are socialised and begin to make key contacts that help progress them to the next stages of their career. Once socialised, people engage in collective learning as they problem-solve on a project-by-project basis. Learning accumulates, disperses, and evolves as industry specialists enact their working environment. 

From micro-level enactment we see macro-level influence and patterns, order and shape in the independent film industry. Not only do we observe distinct stages of careers, we see aggregate social norms influencing behaviour. What one can see from the pattern of progression that characterises freelance boundaryless careers in the film industry is that although few formal boundaries exist, persistent social structures and repeated patterns of interaction can be observed. In the process of enacting their careers, individuals engage in reinforcing the cohesive social patterns of the industry which serve to guide the stages of their development. In this respect careers in the Silicon Valley and the film industry have much in common, with organising in film-making resembling a ‘project-based’ Valley. Just as careers can be traced in the Valley through the development of technology and tightly knit project teams, in film a clear pattern also emerges that reveals micro-level organising shaping macro activity. 

Refinements on enactment 

Agency and communion

Both of our previous examples suggest that the enactment of boundaryless careers unfolds through a mixture of personal initiative and mutual co-operation. Marshall (1989), after Bakan (1966), refers to the elements in this mixture as agency and communion. At a very basic level agency is about control and communion is about co-operation. Agency is individualistic, and characterised by autonomy, independence, initiative, and adaptation. It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development. Communion, in contrast to agency, is concerned about connections, relationships, tolerance, and trust. It is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others.1 

In ‘weak’ environments, in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled, both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty. Agency provides direction and drive to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and long-term goals. Left to its own means, however, agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform, the balance of power to be lost, and, most importantly, the trust and co-operation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited. Communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued. However, unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the mechanisms and rewards through which effective collaboration can occur. 

The Silicon Valley and independent film-making examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion. Agency occurs through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their careers within their adopted industries, communion occurs through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal arrangements. Together, the combination of behaviours supports current high-technology or film-making projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities. This development includes community-building that will influence the make-up and effectiveness of future project teams. Host industries will thrive, our examples suggest, as long as agency and communion are allowed to work in tandem (Rousseau & Arthur, 1999). 

Contemporary views of work frequently lament a loss of community in restructured employment arrangements. However, in calling for a return to community, these views frequently look no further than the single company. An enactment perspective suggests that communities can be much more broadly diffused. Both the Silicon Valley and film-making stories demonstrate that host industries, as well as their embedded occupations, provide alternative contexts for community-building to occur. Other kinds of community – stemming, for example, from shared ideological, family, educational, ethnic, or gender attachments – can also provide enduring support for people’s boundaryless career endeavours (Parker & Arthur, 2000). 

1	Some researchers, notably Marshall (1989), emphasise the feminine characteristics of communion versus the masculine characteristics of agency. We do not do so here, although it may be interesting to contemplate whether the Silicon Valley is, in the broadest sense, ‘feminised’. 

Reciprocity

A related concept is that of reciprocity. Since workers cannot be all things to all people all of the time, a balance of behaviours is required. Reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations. Traditional career models used to prescribe that people offer loyalty in return for deferred rewards. Accordingly, deferred pension rights, vacation time, promotion opportunities, and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had ‘served their time’. In contrast, those who changed employer were handicapped by the loss of the privileges that they left behind. The Silicon Valley and film-making worlds suggest a different logic: one where the old entitlement-based models are a hindrance to boundaryless career investments. 

With boundaryless careers, employment relationships are too fluid to assume the trappings of traditional loyalty-based employment systems. In the simplest case, employment arrangements reflect a ‘spot’ contract involving a simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment. However, our examples suggest subtler forces are at work. People are recruited to participate in high-technology and film-making projects for the skills that they bring – skills that have been developed from previous projects. The system, at its best, consists of cycles in which the learning taken from previous projects is applied in the current project, which in turn provides new learning opportunities. The simple exchange of commitment to do one’s best in return for learning opportunities may be a common one in contemporary employment, and one that inspires many workers to seek new employment pastures when their learning slows down (Arthur, Inkson & Pringle, 1999). 

The concept of reciprocity reinforces the significance of project-based activities. Work which provides an underlying project-based structure, such as in construction (‘jobs’), law (cases), or computing (programmes), provides a particular time span for reciprocities to occur. If the benefits are genuinely mutual, projects provide a basis for high commitment from both parties to the short-term employment contract. Yet, the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the project’s conclusion. Individuals can take their learning from projects and project participants with them. Meanwhile, their influence on other project participants can be retained in the sponsoring company, or the host industry, or both. Ultimately, other industries can also benefit as mobile workers transport best practices to new situations. 

A new continuity 

What general lessons can be claimed from our two examples? Many would argue that traditional employment systems, going back to the factories of the eighteenth century, do not favour boundaryless careers. We agree, but we also live in a time when those systems are failing, and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change. Moreover, those systems were designed according to a conception of ‘labour capital’ rather than to one of ‘intellectual capital’. Yet, it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today. Readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning. Is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large? 

If the workforce at large can learn, what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning? Leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers? Knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know, or at least contribute to knowing, what is best for themselves? Having people trapped by deferred rewards (Williamson, 1975), or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust? 

A colleague recently visited the Czech republic, and explored that country’s relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy. She asked what was the single best thing a Czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market. ‘Work for McDonalds,’ went the surprising reply, ‘but only for six months.’ It was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service. After six months, the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time, from a career perspective, to move on. 

The contrast between working for McDonalds for six months or working for McDonalds for a lifetime is, writ large, the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts. Today’s work is increasingly ‘intelligent’ work (Quinn, 1992), that calls on workers’ learning capacities, and – as our examples suggest – provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold. If that organising structure is lacking, the worker can heed the advice of our Czech informant and design a project for herself or himself. 

In the future, we submit, most careers will be boundaryless. We have sought to illustrate the future by exploring two industries where boundaryless careers have flourished – reaping benefits for people, companies, and host industries alike. New theories, such as Karl Weick’s theory on the enactment of careers, can help us to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics inherent in complex, self-organising, social phenomena. People may not need to move between firms perpetually, but they will need to take charge of their own learning agendas. As they take charge, boundaries will form and re-form, and underlying order provide a macro-economic stability in an environment in which ‘organization man’ has become all but extinct.

style


When an architectural competition was announced for the New York Public Library on May 21, 1897, Dr. John Shaw Billings, the library’s executive director, was determined that in his building, design would not triumph over function. He had in mind Boston’s newly built public library, a beautiful but in his opinion poorly functioning building. Billings, an ex-army physician, was responsible for organizing the Surgeon General’s Library and a celebrated medical index. He was also an expert in hospital design, and was thus familiar with building construction. He drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room. It was not located near the main entrance, as was common practice, but on an upper floor, above the book stacks.
The terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow. There were two stages, intended to attract new talent as well as established firms. First, six architects were chosen from an open competition. These six then advanced to a second stage, where they competed against six invited firms that included not only McKim, Mead & White (the architects of the Boston Public Library), but also such luminaries as Peabody & Stearns, George B. Post, and an up-and-coming young firm, Carrère & Hastings. The up-and-comers carried the day. McKim, much to his chagrin, not only lost but placed third behind Howard & Cauldwell. It was his own fault, since he imperiously ignored the suggested plan and substituted his own arrangement. Carrère & Hastings conscientiously followed Billings’ requirements.
The projected budget for the new library was not large ($1.7 million) and Billings expected a relatively modest building.* That was not what he got. All three designs were monumental. Carrère & Hastings and Howard & Cauldwell used the Modern French style, which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the façade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for. All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors—Corinthian in McKim’s case, Ionic in the other two (the completed building is Corinthian). The compositional strategies were roughly similar: a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor; the entrance was placed in the center (more understated in McKim’s elegant design); statuary and urns adorned the attic. All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate, and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence, dignity, and of culture rooted in the past.
I mentioned the New York Public Library competition when I gave a public lecture in connection with a recent architectural competition for the new Salt Lake City Public Library. The library board had conducted a national search for an architect, visited new libraries across the country, and solicited proposals from prominent architects. They had narrowed their list to four firms: Charles Gwathmey and Robert Siegel are respected New York architects with a long record of university buildings and museums, including a new library of science, industry, and business for the New York Public Library system. Moshe Safdie had built major civic buildings in Israel, Canada, and the United States, and recently completed the public library in Vancouver, British Columbia. Moore Ruble Yudell is a Los Angeles firm founded by the late Charles Moore, with whom John Ruble and Buzz Yudell built several university libraries and a public library in Berlin. Will Bruder, the least well-known of the four, is a southwesterner and the architect of the new, well-regarded Phoenix Public Library.
I told my audience that I thought that the Salt Lake City library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenth-century New York counterparts. It was not a question of function. The Salt Lake City librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements, so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served. As for firmness, I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly. It was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder. Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed, understated buildings in a latter-day version of the International Style. Safdie, too, is a modernist, but he follows in the footsteps of Pei, and his buildings are frankly monumental—the Vancouver library had been likened to the Roman Coliseum. Moore Ruble Yudell’s work is different. Informal and animated, their eclectic Postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings. Bruder, on the other hand, designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements, rough industrial materials, and sleek details. Building on the same site, fulfilling the same functional requirements, and using the same up-to-date construction technology, the four firms would produce libraries that would look different.
The library board awarded the commission to Moshe Safdie, and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled. The new library will feature an unusual triangular-shaped main building and a curving wall-like structure that encloses a public square. A hundred years ago, it was taken for granted that the New York Public Library would be designed in some variant of the Classical style. Today a public library can take many guises. It can be relentlessly avant-garde, like the new $1.5 billion national library in Paris, where the books are housed in four L-shaped 22-story glass towers, and the readers are lodged in underground rooms, which the London Times described as “a series of rectangular salons (identical of course) where you can admire the ultra-smooth gray concrete, steel grille ceilings and the expanses of African veneer.”1 A new library can be comfortably Modernist, like the new British Library in London, which the Independent humorously described as “a giant municipal building that has made its way from Scandinavia, having crashed headfirst through an English brickworks on the way.”2 Tom Beeby’s handsome Harold T. Washington Library in Chicago, on the other hand, is distinctly old-fashioned, with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the city’s nineteenth-century architectural tradition. Instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs, the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs. James Ingo Freed’s Main Public Library in San Francisco, on the other hand, is both old and new: the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less Classical on one façade, and more or less Modernist on another.
The coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new. In a 1913 essay titled “Style in American Architecture,” Ralph Adams Cram identified no less than seven contemporary styles, although he called them “tendencies.” Five were traditional: McKim’s pure Classicism; the Beaux-Arts French Modern; Colonial, which was associated with houses but was also appearing in larger buildings such as the Johns Hopkins University campus; Cram’s own High Gothic; and a looser interpretation of the medieval style as practiced by his partner Goodhue. Two were new: steel-frame construction, which Cram described as an enfant terrible; and what he called the Secessionists—Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago, the Greene brothers in Pasadena—who exhibited “a strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind.” Cram was not sanguine about the future, but he nevertheless concluded: “Chaos then confronts us, in that there is no single architectural following, but legion; and in that fact lies the honor of our art, for neither is society one, or ever at one with itself.”3
Cram is right: most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion; it is stylistic consensus that is unusual. There was such a brief consensus in the late 1890s, when both architects and the American public, under the influence of the immensely popular World’s Columbian Exposition, embraced Classicism, at least for public buildings. That unanimity lasted long enough for the New York Public Library competition, but it began to unravel shortly after, as Cram’s essay makes clear. There was also a consensus in the 1920s, at least among progressive architects. That consensus did not last either. After 1940, Mies van der Rohe gave up the free-flowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the Barcelona Pavilion and the Tugendhat House, and began designing buildings whose details and materials were Modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly Classical. In the 1920s, Le Corbusier proclaimed the “Five Points of a New Architecture”: the building raised on stilts; the roof garden; the frame structure that allowed a free plan; the free façade; and the horizontal ribbon window. He, too, had second thoughts. Thirty years later, his wonderful chapel at Ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame; the roof, far from being flat, resembled a billowing nun’s coif. Le Corbusier, who had coined the famous expression, “a house is a machine for living in,” now adopted distinctly un-machinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete, exposed brick, roughened stucco, and fieldstone. This volte face gave rise to the so-called Brutalist style, which had a worldwide influence, shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as James Stirling and Paul Rudolph, and ultimately opening the door to Postmodern stylistic experiments such as Charles Moore’s little house in the Berkeley hills.
The inconstancy of the International Style practitioners should have been expected. The history of Western architecture is of architects searching for rules, only to bend and break them. Even Classicism, which appears at first glance to be highly regimented, is not immune. As far as we know, the ancient Greeks used only three orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Vitruvius describes them, and also refers to a Tuscan order, which is a Roman invention. Roman, too, is the so-called Composite order, an ornate blend of Ionic and Corinthian. The vault, the arch, and the dome, unknown to the Greeks, were other Roman additions to the Classic canon. Architects have been stretching Classical rules ever since: breaking pediments, flattening pilasters, magnifying and shrinking columns, rusticating masonry. A sixteenth-century French architect, Philibert de l’Orme, invented a French order; Edwin Lutyens devised an order based on Mughal precedents for the Viceroy’s House in New Delhi; more recently, Allan Greenberg created an order for the offices of the Secretary of State that incorporated the Great Seal of the United States. Michael Graves designed Classical caryatids (columns carved in the shape of human figures) to support the pedimented front of an office building for the Walt Disney Company in Burbank. While the supports of the porch of the Erechtheon in Athens take the form of graceful maidens, Graves’ caryatids are the Seven Dwarfs.
The headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple. In the past, religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range. As architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings, warehouses, factories, shops and cinemas, houses and weekend houses—every sort of building—a single style no longer sufficed. Gothic is an evocative style for churches, but despite Walpole’s efforts it is ill-adapted to houses. Romanesque makes imposing city halls, but is too heavy to be applied to skyscrapers. The International Style makes striking small buildings but monotonous large ones. Shingle Style cottages are pleasing; a Shingle Style Home Depot is ridiculous. As Cram wisely observed, “Architecture is nothing unless it is intimately expressive, and if utterly different things clamor for voicing, different also must be their architectural manifestation.”4
The great architects—Brunelleschi, Palladio, Wren, Richardson, Lutyens—regularly looked to the past for inspiration. In 1965, Richard Meier built the Smith House, which has been called the first International Style revival building. Like all revivalists, Meier picks and chooses. At first glance, the Smith House has all the stylistic hallmarks of a Le Corbusier villa of the 1920s: a free plan, flat roof, white walls, pipe railings, horizontal ribbon windows, a ramp. Yet it is built out of wood and steel, not masonry. The white walls are painted wood siding, not stucco; the details are more refined, the plate-glass sheets are larger, the structure lighter. The result is an International Style that is filtered through American consciousness and shaped by American technology. It is like Thomas Jefferson building Classical columns out of wood—the same, but different.
Although art historians use terms like Gothic Revival and Greek Revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles, architects look at history differently. “For the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a self-conscious act of the ‘modern’ will,” writes Roger Scruton in The Aesthetics of Architecture, “but as an enduring fact, an ineliminable part of an extended present.”5 That is why architects, whether they are Inigo Jones or Louis Kahn, make architectural pilgrimages to the Mediterranean roots of Western architecture. Sketchbook in hand, they plumb the secrets of the master builders of the past. Consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style; they instinctively understand that the history of architecture—including the present—is a continuity rather than a series of episodes.
Stylistic consistency is much admired today, but it was not always so. In 1419, Filippo Brunelleschi began the Foundling Hospital in Florence, whose delicate arcade of Corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the Renaissance. At the very same time, he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of Florence in a style that was not Classical but distinctly Gothic, pointed arches and all. The German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel is best known for his severe Classical public buildings such as the superb Altes Museum in Berlin, but he also worked in other styles: Gothic in churches, and picturesque Italianate in villas. McKim, Mead & White favored the Classical style for public buildings and palatial residences, but built Norman parish churches, Shingle Style summer retreats, French Renaissance mansions, and American Colonial country houses. John Russell Pope, an eclectic master, designed beautiful picturesque Tudor, Georgian, and Colonial country estates. Edwin Lutyens was another Classicist whose residential work was eclectic.
Domestic architects had to be adaptable, because house styles changed according to fashion. In the United States, Tudor was popular in the 1900s, as was the Free Style; Cotswold and French Provincial appeared in the 1920s. After the 1930s, influenced by the restoration of Williamsburg, American Colonial returned to favor. The Cotswold style, with its relatively severe details and blunt forms, created a very different setting from French Provincial, which tended to have more delicate details, from Free Style with its almost rustic atmosphere, or from sturdy Colonial. Since historic styles carry cultural overtones, using different styles was also a way for architects—and clients—to say different things.
If architectural style is a language—an analogy that is deeply flawed—it is closer to slang than to grammatical prose. Architectural styles are mutable, unregulated, improvised. Architects break the rules, and invent new ones. In part, this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals. In part, architects break stylistic rules because they can. After all, most of the rules that govern building design—fire codes, building codes, zoning laws, budgets, programmatic requirements, engineering norms—are outside the architect’s control; stylistic rules are firmly within his purview. Since architecture is so intensely competitive, doing something unexpected, unusual, or just different is a way to be noticed, to rise above the crowd.
In addition to historical styles, there have also been styles associated with individual architects. The Palladian style made its way from Andrea Palladio to Inigo Jones, from him to Colen Campbell and Lord Burlington, and thence to Thomas Jefferson. It reappears in the work of contemporary Classicists such as Allan Greenberg. H. H. Richardson’s influence was considerably shorter-lived, but for at least 20 years Richardsonian Romanesque rolled over the United States like an “aesthetic Juggernaut,” in Cram’s colorful phrase. Mies van der Rohe’s steel-and-glass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades, and his characteristic I-beam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain walls.
Buildings like Jones’ Palladian Queen’s House in Greenwich, Adler & Sullivan’s Richardsonian Romanesque Auditorium Building in Chicago, and Gordon Bunshaft’s Miesian Lever House are not copies but satisfying originals. However, most personal styles are not easily adaptable. A building in Wright’s unmistakable Prairie style, for example, simply looks like a knock-off. Some personal styles are simply too obsessive, which is probably why Frank Furness and the equally idiosyncratic Barcelona architect Antonio Gaudí never attracted a following.
Inigo Jones consciously based his work on the architecture of Palladio, but he did not think of himself as working in the Palladian “style,” any more than Palladio would have referred to the Classical “style.” Although Renaissance architects described their architecture as all’antica—in the antique manner—they took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression: the Romans improved on the Greeks, and they would improved on the Romans. According to the architecture historian Peter Collins, the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late. He cites James Stuart and Nicholas Revett’s Antiquities of Athens, published in 1762 and credited with inaugurating the Classical Revival in England. The authors, both architects, referred to “the Grecian and Roman style of building.”6
The Latin root of “style” is stilus. A stilus was the sharp-pointed tool used to write on wax tablets and, by inference, stilus also referred to the way that something was written. This sense of technique carried over to English, and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed. The seventeenth-century English musical composer Samuel Wesley put it neatly: “Style is the dress of thought.” Jacques-François Blondel, who was Louis XV’s architect and who founded the first full-time school of architecture in Europe in 1750, adopted this literary meaning as a metaphor and described architectural style as a building’s character—for example, rustic, regal, or heroic. “Style in the organization of façades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture,” he taught his students, “which alone makes all the architect’s compositions truly interesting.”7
Literary style described the way that something was written, expressed, or performed. Architectural style, in Blondel’s sense, describes the way that something was built. Although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space, light, and volume, buildings are above all physical artifacts. The experience of architecture is palpable: the grain of wood, the veined surface of marble, the cold precision of steel, the textured pattern of brick. But exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork? We see the joints between the bricks and the mortar (which can be flush, or scraped out to create shadows; the bonding patterns; the way that the bricks turn the corner; the surrounding of openings; and the connection between the brick wall and the foundation or the eaves. What we see are details.
Details are a major preoccupation of the architect. Once the overall form of a building is determined—“the masterly, correct, and magnificent play of masses brought together in light”—there remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled, but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed: from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboards.
The function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor, and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing. There are dozens of ways that this can be done. Baseboards can be prominent or discreet, a complicated assembly of board, cap and base, or a simple strip of hardwood. Or nothing—many modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether. The baseboards in my living room are twelve inches tall. They are not wood but cast iron, since they are really disguised radiators. My house was built in 1908, influenced by the British Free Style of Voysey and Baillie Scott, and to further preserve a simple, rustic atmosphere the architect had the baseboards/radiators painted to resemble wood.
Railings have a simple function—they must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them, and they must provide a secure hand-hold: if railings are open, the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through. Classical railings, developed during the Renaissance, consist of balusters supporting a handrail. Balusters—little columns—can have a single or a double swelling curve, or a vase shape. Fabricated in wood or masonry, they can be round or square in cross-section, and plain or highly ornamented. Railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens. These can be stone or metal: bronze, wrought, or cast iron. The screens can be simple X-shapes, intertwining geometrical patterns, or complicated floral figures as in Art Nouveau staircases. Perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great Adirondack camps, whose builders mimicked X-shaped wrought-iron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunks.
Modern railings are usually metal. In his early villas, Le Corbusier used white-painted pipe railings to create a nautical image; in later buildings like the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard, flat steel bars take the place of pipes. The railings in Mies van der Rohe’s buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail, located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor; the vertical stanchions, the handrail, and the rail are made of identical square steel bars. The railings in Louis Kahn buildings tend to be parapets, but where he is obliged to use an open railing the design is as simple as possible. I have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar, bent at each end to form the uprights. Richard Meier uses metal railings, too, but because there are sometimes as many as six horizontal rails, the visual effect is more pronounced—they resemble staffs in sheet music.
When Brutalism was in fashion, railings were correspondingly heavy: concrete beams, wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch, or massive wood balustrades, as solid as fenders on a truck dock. The vogue among many younger architects today is toward lightness and exposed construction, and railings reflect that fashion, too. The screens of the railings of Peter Rose’s Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal are industrial-looking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum, prominently bolted to the stanchions. Bernard Tschumi substitutes steel cables (complete with turnbuckles) for the intermediate horizontal rails of the ramp railings of Lerner Hall at Columbia University, another nautical reference, but to a yacht rather than a steamship. These solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that I. M. Pei designed for the East Building of the National Gallery. The stainless steel handrail highlights the solidity of the rose-colored Tennessee marble by appearing to float in mid-air, since it is supported by continuous sheets of tempered glass embedded in the floor.
The transparent railings of I. M. Pei’s East Building are understated, elegant, and luxurious—like the building. “Beauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole with respect to the several parts,” taught Palladio, “of the parts with regard to each other, and of these again to the whole.”8 The successful relationship of the details to each other, and to the building is governed by the architect’s sense of style. That is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood; a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver; a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall. The role of details is not to complement architecture; details are architecture. “The aesthetic understanding [of architecture],” writes Roger Scruton, “is inseparable from a sense of detail.”9 Mies van der Rohe is supposed to have said “God is in the details.”* He did not mean that details are functionally important (although they are), or that good details prolong the life of a building (although they do). He meant that details are the soul of architecture. That is why, just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards, or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments, it is possible to divine the architect’s idea of a building by examining its details.
The house that Robert Venturi built for his mother in 1964 shook the foundations of the International Style; much of this effect was the result of details. Although Venturi obviously was working in a Modernist idiom—there is a strip window and a steel-pipe railing—he also incorporated distinctly un-Modernist features such as trim, both inside and out. Classical architects use a large variety of moldings—fillet, astragal, egg and dart, ogee—that can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect. The International Style, in its effort to do away with ornament, outlawed trim. Walls were flat planes. Windows had no frames. Joints between materials were simply hairline cracks. The conspicuous exterior dado, the baseboards, and the chair-rails in the Vanna Venturi House were hardly Classical moldings—they were merely boards with chamfered edges—yet they challenged the assumption that trim and Modernism were incompatible.
Coming through the front door of the Vanna Venturi House one immediately senses that it is an unusual place. A broad stair rises beside the fireplace, then peters out to almost nothing. The fireplace looks like an abstract sculpture, but it has a traditional mantelpiece. A free-standing column à la Corbusier stands beside a chair-rail. Then there is the furniture. Ever since the Tugendhat House—for which Mies had designed the furniture—it was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture. Venturi has explained that “I designed the house so my mother’s old furniture (c. 1925, plus some antiques) would look good in it.”10 Instead of the iconic bent-tube Breuer chairs, there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table; instead of an Eames lounge chair and ottoman, a comfortable stuffed sofa. It is a contradictory atmosphere—the International Style willfully distorted through the lens of traditional bourgeois domesticity.
Whether one is looking up at the tall dome of the Pantheon, descending the spiraling vortex of Wright’s Guggenheim Museum, or standing in the living room of Venturi’s small house, the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate, distinct world. That is what distinguishes architecture from sculpture—it is not an object but a place. The sense of being in a special place that is a three-dimensional expression of the architect’s imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture. To create a strong sense of place, the surroundings must be all of a piece; space, mass, shapes, and materials must reflect the same sensibility. That is why details are so important. A jarring detail or an inconsistency—something “out of place”—and the fantasy begins to crumble. Yes, fantasy. Illusion has been a part of architecture ever since the ancient Greeks made columns with a gently swelling taper to deceive the eye. This is not to say that architecture is stage décor. When the wind blows, the canvas scenery blows over; the building resists the elements. Architecture surrounds and shelters us. It is the real world but it is also a vision.
•••
The Postmodern movement that followed the Vanna Venturi House was relatively short-lived but it had an important consequence: it broke the stranglehold of Modernism, leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression. The profusion of styles that ensued is demonstrated by the work of three gifted but vastly different architects, Allan Greenberg, Hugh Newell Jacobsen, and Enrique Norten.
Allan Greenberg is a confirmed Classicist. He does not consider this an anomaly. “To be truly modern,” he writes, “means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present. Classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed.”11 Although Greenberg looks to the past, his is not the attitude of an archeologist. Like Carrère & Hastings, and generations of architects before them, Greenberg approaches Classicism as a tradition to be studied, absorbed—then extended.
Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.
One of my favorite Greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard. Completed in 1992, the low-lying building is shingled, but it is not exactly Shingle Style. Recent Shingle Style buildings are often broken down into many small parts, giving them a fussy and nervous appearance. Such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away. Greenberg’s aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub. The one-story Atlantic façade is almost perfectly symmetrical: a large arched window flanked by two semi-circular bays, rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds. The two-story landward side is more informal, ringed by a sheltered porch. Massivity informs the details: sturdy Tuscan columns, a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof, rugged window frames. The sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy: the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves. Inside, the fireplace has a brick hearth, a slate lintel, and a wood surround, whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece. The ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough, reused timbers. Although most people would describe this house as “traditional,” this is not an exercise in a particular historical style. There is a nod here to the British Arts and Crafts architect  C. F. A. Voysey, and it is obvious that Greenberg has looked at Lutyens’ country houses. But this is a modern house, although designed by an architect with a Classical sensibility. It admirably fulfills Palladio’s call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole.
Hugh Newell Jacobsen studied at Yale under Louis Kahn, worked for Philip Johnson, and opened his own office in 1958. He established himself as a premier residential architect, winning commissions in the United States and abroad and receiving numerous design awards. Several of the awards were for restoration of historic buildings, notably the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., and the Hôtel Talleyrand in Paris. A Modernist by training and inclination, Jacobsen was, nevertheless, affected by the winds of change unleashed by Venturi’s little house. Starting in 1980, he evolved a hybrid style in which American regional forms and materials are combined with International Style precision, spareness, and simplicity. A house on Nantucket in shingles and white trim looks vernacular until one notices the careful proportions and refined, elegant details such as tall French doors in the living room that slide into wall pockets that also conceal shutters and screen doors. A post-and-beam Caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack. The Palladian plan and temple-like pavilions of an Ohio residence pay homage to the local Greek Revival. An Ohio country house recalls a board-and-batten Gothic Revival farmhouse. “I endeavor to design buildings that express a sense of belonging,” Jacobsen says, “buildings that reflect or abstract the nearby architecture and the traditions dictated by the climate and local materials.”12
The Palmedo House, built in 1988, reinterprets the American Colonial architecture of its location—Long Island. At first glance, the six pavilions resemble a little village, a little Amish village, judging from the austere white wood siding, the prim details, and the identical pitched roofs. Each pavilion is a perfect little “house” with identical square and vertical multi-paned windows (that open by sliding into cunning wall pockets). This sounds precious, but Jacobsen is not a romantic. The central “house” contains the living room, a three-story space open to the roof. Although the multi-paned windows are present at an upper level of the wall, the corner of the room is glazed with large, mullionless sheets of plate glass, offering dramatic views of Long Island Sound. This is an International Style device, as is the economy of detail and the clean, cool, atmosphere of the interior. On the other hand, the fireplace, which in an orthodox International Style house would be painted brick or bush-hammered concrete, is decorously built into the wall, which gives the room a traditional, civilized air. The chief idea here is to highlight the tension between old and new, between the traditional clapboarded architecture and the demands of modern life. Whereas Greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension, Jacobsen allows it to surface. If this sounds like textbook Postmodernism, it is not. Jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of irony.
Jacobsen reacts to the collapse of Modernism by seeking a compromise position, while Greenberg anchors himself in the certainties of Classicism. Enrique Norten, the youngest of the three, takes a different course—he is trying to put Modernism back together again. Norten, who studied at Cornell, established his office in his native Mexico City in 1985. In a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional, commercial, and residential buildings. His major projects are a services building for the media giant TELEVISA and the National School of Theater. Both incorporate bulging, metal shell-roofs that recall the 1950s buildings of the French architect-engineer Jean Prouvé. Prouvé was intent on applying new methods of construction, particularly industrialization and prefabrication. His buildings, extremely light and assembled from standardized elements, were real “machines for living.” Norten, too, is preoccupied with industrial building technologies, the lighter the better. Double-tensed glass curtain walls are mysteriously supported by a steel-frame. Roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts. Slender, canted columns brace a glass-roofed portico. Railings, in a Norten design, are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain: suspended sheets of glass, stretched steel cables, perforated metal screens.
In 1994, Norten built a house for himself and his family on a tight urban site in Mexico City. The three-story street façade is mostly a blank concrete wall; the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass. The main living floor is open, except for the kitchen; the upper bedroom floor is shaded and given privacy by a redwood, louvered screen. A functionalist style pervades the house. The clinical cabinetwork is white-painted wood. A concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks. The windows are large sections of plate glass in simple aluminum frames; a 10-foot section slides aside to entirely open the dining room to the patio. The sliding wall recalls the disappearing windows in Mies van der Rohe’s Tugendhat House, but the resemblance ends here. Mies’ spare interior is opulent and assertive; Norten’s is austere, almost monastic: a neutral background for family life. This is an unsentimental idea of the home. Not exactly a “machine for living,” but certainly machinelike in its precision and rational layout.
Like Greenberg and Jacobsen, Norten reflects on the past. Although his house has little to do formally with the International Style of the flat-roofed stucco villas of the 1920s—except for the white-painted circular steel columns—it shares that period’s ambitions; it is highly abstract, idealistic, technophile, and lacking in applied ornament. Decoration results not from trim, but from the surface quality of the different materials—concrete, red oak flooring, etched glass—and from the relentless articulation of structural connections. Norten’s buildings exhibit another feature of the International Style: they are placeless. That is, while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site, they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context. Whether they are in Mexico or New Mexico—where Norten is building a heritage center—the style is the same: understated, coolly competent, cosmopolitan.
Whether one prefers the work of Greenberg, Jacobsen, or Norten is a matter of taste (I happen to like all three). The buildings are different, yet the three architects have something in common. They are serious about what they are doing, that is, their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction. They pay enormous attention to details. They are disciplined, but they understand their self-imposed rules well enough to occasionally break them. Moreover, while their architecture is built with a great sense of style, it is never merely stylized. That is because in their buildings, style—the manner of expression—is always in the service of content—that which is being expressed. Style without content quickly degenerates into caricature, like a speaker who makes grand gestures and rhetorical flourishes, but has nothing to say. The buildings of Greenberg, Jacobsen, and Norten, on the contrary, have a great deal to tell us about our past, our surroundings, and ourselves.
Greenberg, Jacobsen, and Norten do not describe what they do in terms of style. I think that there are a number of reasons that architects are uncomfortable talking about the subject. A suspicion of style is a heritage of the Modern Movement, which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion, while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency. So deep-rooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects, whether or not they are Modernists. Perhaps another reason for the reluctance to discuss style is fear. Fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a box—like most creative people, architects dislike being categorized. Also fear that talking about style will make architecture—a serious business—sound frivolous. Better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers, professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy. Finally, there is an unspoken fear of style because it is subject to the whims and the fancies of fashion. That fear, at least, seems to me to be ill-founded. An architecture that recognizes style—and fashion—would not be an architecture that is introspective and self-referential, as are so many contemporary buildings. It would be part of the world—not architecture for architects, but architecture for the rest of us. And that would not be a bad thing.

Richard Morris Hunt was the most celebrated American architect of the late nineteenth century. His preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works: the centerpiece building of the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, and the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty. He was feted at home and abroad. Hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from Harvard and the first American to receive a Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects, and he was made an honorary member of the French Académie and a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. A hundred years later, his counterpart is Frank O. Gehry. Since being awarded the prestigious Pritzker Prize in 1989, Gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect, including such major arts awards as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize (a non-architectural award of which he is the first recipient) and the Japanese Praemium Imperiale, the Nobel of the art world. Even the staid American Institute of Architects, which had previously shunned Gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners, awarded him its top accolade, the AIA Gold Medal.
No pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple, the proper High Society favorite of the Gilded Age and the untidy bohemian from Santa Monica. Yet they bear comparison. They were both late bloomers. Gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition. Until then, he had been running his own office in Los Angeles for almost twenty years, building shopping centers, suburban offices, department stores, and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of L.A. modern. The project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house: a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling Cubist composition of unpainted plywood, corrugated metal, and chain-link fencing. The odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked Gehry as a maverick. That was in 1978. Unexpectedly, he attracted a broad range of commissions, not only residential clients, but also museums, public institutions, universities, corporations, and developers, and not only in the United States but around the world.
Hunt was 43 when he came into his own. He had established an architectural practice in New York in 1855, almost immediately on his return from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He was moderately successful, achieving local renown for the Tribune Building, an early New York skyscraper. Despite his Parisian background, Hunt worked in the prevalent Ruskinian Gothic style. Of his Presbyterian Hospital in downtown Manhattan, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler wrote: “The building is of Gothic design with very red brick, and very irregular stone dressings, which, it must be confessed regretfully, are not pleasing to the eye.”3 For his next project, the Lenox Library, Hunt tried something different. He borrowed from the French Neo-Grec style, popularized by Labrouste in the Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève, adding Renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling. The result was a startling departure from convention, a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity. The Lenox Library (which stood on Fifth Avenue on the site of the present-day Frick Collection) marked a shift in architectural taste, away from Ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic Classicism. The 1880s was a decade of great prosperity, and newly wealthy New Yorkers eagerly sought out Hunt’s architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display. He obliged them in a string of high-profile commissions: magnificent mansions along Fifth Avenue, country houses on Long Island, and palatial “cottages” in Newport, Rhode Island. Hunt died in 1895, but in the last seven years of his life, he completed more than fifty projects.
Biltmore House in Asheville, North Carolina, is a good example of his stylistic prowess. Hunt modeled the design of this 250-room residence on the Château de Blois, whose style is not the severe Classicism of the Italian Renaissance favored by architects such as Charles McKim, but the more ornate and picturesque French Renaissance. To a modern visitor, the spires, turrets, and steep slate roofs of Biltmore recall Disneyland’s Sleeping Beauty Castle, which is not surprising since Disney also used a Loire Valley chateau—the Château d’Ussé—as his model. But the comparison does Hunt an injustice, for his design is neither prettified nor quaint. His client, George W. Vanderbilt, was a young bachelor (he married soon after the house was finished), and for him Hunt created an architecture that is robust, masculine, and immensely self-assured, not in the least like a fairytale.
Vanderbilt was drawn to French chateaux, which Hunt showed him during a whirlwind European tour, since young George and his wealthy family imagined themselves American aristocrats. There are coats of arms bearing Vs all over the house. Hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting, but deals with the past in his own peculiar way. Although he modeled the building on Blois, he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenth-century chateau, but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole. Nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenth-century building—there is no artificial weathering, no aging effect no simulated historicism. The interior is modern, bright, and open. The focus of the main floor is a glass-roofed conservatory, a common nineteenth-century feature. The stonework of the house is impeccable, much crisper and more sharply defined than at Blois. Hunt was no antiquarian, and modern American technology abounds. The floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel I-beams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses. Cast iron replaces wrought iron and high-quality bricks, fired in the estate brickworks, back-up the limestone walls. Equally novel are the elevators and telephones, electrical lighting, hot and cold running water, and forced air central heating. There is no doubt that for Hunt, Biltmore is an up-to-the-minute modern building. That is part of its style, too.
Like Hunt, Frank Gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, for example, is clad in titanium, previously used chiefly for building aircraft. The metallic walls curve, twist, and turn. One part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge; another emerges from a reflecting pool. Bilbainos refer to the museum as the “artichoke,” which comes close to describing it, if you can imagine a gleaming, metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high. The seeming disorder—a chaotic collision of forms—has no architectural precedent. This is not sculptural architecture, it is walk-in sculpture.
“The plan is the generator” preached Le Corbusier, but with Gehry, the plan is the result. He appears to design from the outside in. The building as a composition comes first, the interior spaces follow. This implies that he shoehorns functions into the building, which is not the case. The Guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces: traditional, skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early Modernist art; a long boat-like space for temporary installations; and 11 smaller galleries, each with its own character, each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist. The artichoke accommodates them all. The building may appear offhanded, but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized.
Gehry’s talent is his exceptional formal imagination; his skill as an architect is to reconcile the forms he imagines with the functional demands of his client. And, of course, to find ways to build those forms. This is generally done without fuss. The titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a Shingle Style roof; limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion, without articulated joints. Gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the International Style, but he deploys these details to different ends. By removing familiar elements such as coping strips, fascias, and trim, he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings. There are no roofs or walls or windows in the Guggenheim, there are only swirling and twisting planes of metal, stone, and glass. An architecture critic once described Gehry as “a smart man from Hollywood,” which nicely captures the architect’s blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behind-the-scenes savvy.
Although sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in Gehry’s buildings, like Hunt, he keeps technology off center stage. In that regard, he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects. Neither is he nostalgic about the past. Gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the International Style and the traditions of Classicism. Architects have broken rules in the past, but rarely this unequivocally and totally.
Gehry, like Hunt, has changed the course of architecture. That is, he has made us look at our surroundings in a different way. The world of Gehry’s buildings is, at first glance, an odd place. The line between order and disorder is a thin one, and it is difficult to know what is intended and what is accidental. But his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening. This is the way we live today, Gehry seems to be saying, why not enjoy it?







>Hotel California

Fact: Sound is a vibration. Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no
medium. So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing. After the
first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder. Eyes bulging in
panic, but no screams. Quiet and peaceful, right? Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter
about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave. I
swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up
from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey. Metaphorically, of course.

Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself
into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live. This is more than the person would have
sans space suit. Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has
followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up;
yes, studies have been done. So, twenty-four hours. Give or take.

About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating
felt like, that's when I heard a bell.

My first thought: I was going crazy. Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating
noises now?

I heard it again. It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd
seen in documentaries. And accompanying the bell, I saw a light.

Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense. First, the whole in-a-vacuum
why's-there-a-bell thing. Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable
light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less
bright.

These signals were the heralds of my saviors.

The first words they said to me meant nothing. I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was
going to keep breathing. Next to those, nothing else mattered. The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and
all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like
sex, only better. (I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.)

When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around. The ship, it was odd and
old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew
standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk. And me, I guess I was
one more piece in their puzzle. I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was
found.

I was now one of them.

This story, it's our story. The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the
fateful crashes: this is us. Floating alone, each of us facing the silence of the vacuum, we were found.

Once found, we can never be lost.

This is our Hotel California.

We can never leave.

“So, I'm on a ship now? You do this a lot?”

A woman, introduced as Tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful, shrugged. “Now and then.”

“What about my crewmates? Why didn't you save them?” As much as Jesse had irritated me, I didn't like the
picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave, body swollen and bloated. Who would tell his girl how he
had died?

“Couldn't,” said the captain. Jefferson, he called himself, clean-shaven and smart, a picture of the perfect
entrepreneur. An opportunist and a businessman, that was Jefferson. “We're selective about our passengers,” he
continued. “You fit the bill. They didn't.”

Tiffany, she looked at the captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder. She turned
to me. “Come on,” she said, before I could say anything else, “let's get you settled in.” No time for
questions. No time for answers.

 The ship had all the usual accoutrements (artificial gravity, tastefully painted walls, sound dampeners to
keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane, recycled air systems), and a few
less-usual: lush carpeting, lighting that was decorative as well as functional, spacious corridors. The
occasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met,
primarily). Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways; music; voices; the aroma of real food.

This was heaven. No seventy-two virgins, but it would do.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

Tiffany looked back. “To your quarters. It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”

“No, I meant, where's the ship going? What's our destination?”

Tiffany, she stopped walking. She gave me a look, pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to
share the news. “Honey,” she said, “You're going to be delighted. Destination everywhere. Destination
nowhere.”

This was hell. I died in those last moments, suffocating on my own exhaled breath, and this, this was my
reward.

Fact: The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three
hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second.

It took me a couple days to realize I was, in fact, still alive. I mean, sure, I'd had my moment of elation
when I had first realized I'd been rescued, but it didn't sink in. After watching my ship tear apart, after
spending a good twenty-three hours floating in silence in the wreck, wondering whether I was currently facing
stars belonging to the constellation Libra or the constellation Orion when those stars were viewed from Earth,
wondering what it felt like to suffocate, and after the feeling that yes, I was in fact going to die alone in
space had sunk in, it took time for that feeling to dissipate.

Fact: I wasn't dead.

After I realized this, I left my quarters. The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official
meals were taking place, but I hadn't bothered to acknowledge the invitations. It hadn't seemed relevant,
somehow, given that I was still reeling over the explosion, the deaths of my crewmates, and the rescue. I've
heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them. Food was
delivered to my quarters. Initially, I couldn't figure out why—I hadn't requested any be sent. Then I realized,
someone must have noticed I hadn't left, and was nice enough to send food my way. The accompanying bottle of
wine was a nice touch. I must have consumed it, too, because later on, the plates and the bottle were both
empty. I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the
ceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars. I did a lot of staring
and not moving.

Man, was it good to be done with that stage. 

It was time to find out what hell looked like.

Fact: Hell is other people. Sure, the ship was spacious. We didn't pick up many passengers—just the select,
special few, scattered here and there between the stars. But we were all on this ship, and we were on it
together.

Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people. Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming
forty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the
other. She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro
cream dip onto a plate. The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish,
paprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of
meat smothered in a tomato-based sauce. Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class
space stations and pleasure cruisers. Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it
was mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous. I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days
had been similarly amazing. I decided it couldn't have been.

“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.” She
looked me over approvingly. “Come on, let's get you a glass of champagne.” I looked longingly at the slices of
cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest.

The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot. It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a
nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her. I marveled at the robot's
smoothness and coordination. Clearly, it was a high-end model. Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and
pulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us.

I spent the evening listening, mostly. Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food
provided. No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter.
Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald. Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze.
He made me a little uncomfortable. Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached
nearly to her waist. I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the
crowd again later. Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so
had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted
this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat
pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact.

After the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight. I
wasn't learning anything useful. I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first.
Tonight was for observation. I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more
interesting people, though. They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less
apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared. I wondered at the ship instead. All the fine
food and the ornamental lighting, it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain. If the barkeep was any
indication, I suspected similarly high-class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship. How they were all
powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink. It was
the brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it
did ate up a lot of resources.

Sarah's crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled, all seemingly pleased to have
a new set of ears to talk at. I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised
to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen
movies—that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station.

By the end of the evening, when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room, a satisfying
haze had settled on my mind. It was nice, I decided. This ship. This life. The nagging questions about where
the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged, but somehow, seemed less urgent.
Did it truly matter what the ship's origin was and why Jefferson had saved me, if now, I was content?

Fact: It's easy to fall into patterns. I would wake late, checking the clock on my room's lightscreen to
make sure I hadn't slept through brunch. I would join the rest of the ship for meals, and I would take my turn
in the weight room. I would watch old films on the entertainment screens, taking mental notes for later
dinnertime discussions. I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks. I would attend afternoon dance
classes, so that when the evening dances came around (modeled after the historical social gatherings of several
hundred years prior), I would be less of an embarrassment to myself.

I did not ask questions. I told myself I should. I told myself that tonight, the observation period would
end and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery. But I fell under the ship's sway. Bereft of my previous
familiar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and
then (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills
left something to be desired). I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long-awaited vacation,
my clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow. I continued to care little
for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic,
story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an
engineer. It was a good life, if surreal. But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.

Fact: Some places are timeless. Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or
years since I was rescued. All there was, all I remembered, was a blur. Gathering for drinks in the parlors,
playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets (some of it modern, some of it period dress
for special themed events), idling in the lounges. Now and then, a new face mingled in the crowd. Other faces
washed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the
engines.

One of these evenings, we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post-dinner drinks, lounging on couches
and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor. (The 'South' was in the title to
suggest that there were more ballrooms. There weren't.) Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer,
Adrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on
Earth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her. Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a
question I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something
special about that evening. Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some
breaking point. Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of
thought. We dredged up half-fledged theories and inchoate explanations, tossing these out the same way we
pitched ideas about the art films.

“I believe we'll see the end of the universe,” said Tiffany. Captain's cohort, she had a glass of
orange-brown liquid in one hand; it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor. She swirled it
speculatively. I watched Adrienne. She tilted her head, listening, not speaking.

“Impossible,” said Zheng, sitting in the chair to her left. “We can't live that long.”

“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,” said Jefferson. Yeah, the captain was there, with the
rest of us. He didn't drink, but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques.

“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,” said Sarah, setting her wine glass on the
little round end table by her couch. “Maybe we're already traveling at the speed of light.” 

Tiffany, she nodded eagerly. “Relatively says it all.”

Zheng scoffed. “Also impossible. Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed
of light—that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't—we'd
still age. We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”

“And?” said Sarah. “Aging is relative, anyway. Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever. Give our
ancestors purpose. Keep their dreams alive.”

“New hypothesis,” suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation. “No one's immortal. In fact, the
opposite: We're all going to die.”

“Bleak,” commented Zheng. “But I like it.” He grinned at Sarah, who frowned. Ray took a drink from his glass
of ice water, and shook his head.

“We're all going to die, so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have?” Kishori gestured to the
bar, the carpets, the paintings. “All the luxuries money can buy.”

Tiffany took a drink, thinking. “All the luxuries money can buy,” she echoed.

Zheng looked skeptical. “Paid for how?”

“Smuggling,” responded Kishori. Matter-of-fact. Jefferson snorted, amused. “Think about it,” Kishori
continued, “where else would we get the money to buy all this?”

“Renegade smugglers. So what's our cargo, eh, captain?” Zheng joked, leaning back in his chair with his
glass of wine.

Jefferson shook his head and stood up. “I'll leave you to your speculation,” he said. A chorus of good
nights followed him out the door.

After the captain left, Zheng leaned in. He set his glass down on an end table, steepled his fingers
together. “We're revolting,” he told us. “And I don't mean that you disgust me. No, we're the start of a
rebellion. Did you hear what the captain said earlier? He means, we're going to change the future. The universe
as we know it won't be the same.”

“That's dumb,” said Sarah. “Wouldn't we know it if we were part of a rebellion?

Zheng shook his head. “The captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence—how else would he
know where to find us? He knows about us.”

“That's still dumb,” said Sarah. “Inside intelligence? Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big
galactic government from which to steal information.”

“I still like my idea,” said Tiffany.

Me, I followed Adrienne's example and didn't speak up (fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in
gather-info observation mode), though I thought Zheng had a point. Jefferson didn't share how he found people.
He didn't share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others. But then
again, no one asked. I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing. He had been at this savior business
longer than any of us. I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that.

“We're going to mean something,” Zheng was saying. “What we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many
governments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.” He sounded certain. Enthusiastic, even.

Ray, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening. “You've got it all wrong.” He
looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me. “Obviously, we can't last longer than
the rest of the universe. We aren't giving anyone purpose. We're not even going to leave a legacy. All we're
doing is existing. All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing
important, ever. We aren't special.”

“Again, bleak,” commented Zheng. Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet. She leaned forward, setting her
elbows on the foot stool in front of her.

“You never know when it will end,” Ray continued, not addressing any one of us in particular. “You can't
hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long
until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you
hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces
and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have
left?”

I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship. I wondered why, if he had such an unpropitious outlook, he
hadn't tried to change his situation. I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious
to interrupt.

“You can try to hold on,” said Ray. “You can try and try and try. Repeat stories to yourself in the
artificial night, sketch faces in your mind. You can make their names your mantra. But words, if you repeat
them enough times, lose their meaning. Emily emily em-ill-ee em-i-lee eh-mill-ee eh-mih-lee. My wife's name,
once. Repeat it enough times, it's just a sound. No longer grounded.”

Ray, he said, “If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't
mean a thing to us. We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. We aren't
angels. We're just dumb and lucky.”

“Pure dumb luck,” he said.

“Struck a nerve, huh?” said Zheng. 

“Sorry,” said Ray. 

“How long ago was that?” asked Adrienne. “Leaving your wife, I mean. Traveling on this ship.”

Ray, he looked down at his hands, folded together in his lap, fingers interlaced. “I don't know,” he said.
We were all quiet for a moment. Ray shrugged, then got up and left. We let him go. Silent. Self-conscious. More
excuses were made, and after a few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom. She looked
across the circle of couches at me.

“What's your theory?” she asked me.

I shrugged.

“How long have you been here?”

“Not that long,” I said. “A couple weeks, I guess. Maybe a month or two.”

“Why don't you know for sure?” she asked.

I shrugged. I hadn't been counting days.

“What did you do before this? How were you found?”

“I was an engineer.” I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all. The explosions, the
impossible rescue. “I don't know how Jefferson knew to find me there.”

She nodded. “The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too. Some vital part broke, and... well,
boom. It was all so fast.” She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained
earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me. “I'm going to figure it out,” she
said. “How and why this ship exists. I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”

I paced my room that night, unable to sleep. The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made.
Worse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question. I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly
getting nowhere.

Fact: Adrienne intimidated me.

Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.

I resolved to break the pattern.

Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres.
Another circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question.

“Has anyone ever left?” Adrienne looked at each of us in turn.

Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng.

Sarah frowned. “Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days. I assumed he was indisposed.”
Kishori nodded in agreement.

I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow. “What?”

“Well,” Ray said, slowly, “People do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event
is always the same. But we see new faces.”

“You're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? ” asked Adrienne, using Sarah's
phrasing.	

Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table. “Keep
adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall. A couple people staying in their rooms, even if
you switch out the people, won't make a difference.” He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one.

“So where do they go?” Adrienne focused on Zheng. 

I cut in. “Maybe a better question is, does anyone ever come back?”

Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance. Kishori chewed her lip. Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink.
After a moment, Ray said, “I don't think so.”

“Are there patterns?” Adrienne asked. “Who leaves?”

Again, there was an uncomfortable moment of silence. I hazarded a guess. “You don't notice, do you.”

Sarah looked indignant. “Of course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't
really matter, does it.” I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing.
No one contradicted her. No one offered a different answer.

I looked at Adrienne. Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted. The scales had
tipped. Even when the conversation returned to lighter tones, as it soon did, I dwelt on Adrienne's questions.
From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same.

“How long have you been here?”

The question, previously posed to me, was presented to the rest of our group (excluding Ray; Adrienne had
been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill, recalling the last time the subject was
broached).

Sarah, she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass. “A long time. Got to be months
and months, at least.”

“You were here before I was,” said Kishori, “and so was Tiffany.”

I looked at Zheng; he shrugged. “Time passes in a weird way here. I kept track for a while—thirty-eight
days—but after that... I guess I didn't see the point.”

Fact: Some places are timeless.

“Why not?” asked Adrienne.

“Days don't matter,” he said. “The eleventh of a month or the seventeenth, whether it's Wednesday or Sunday,
summer back on Earth or winter, it doesn't affect us here.”

Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could. “Why are you so interested?” she asked
Adrienne.

Adrienne met her gaze. “I don't want to be here forever.”

“But we're not here forever,” objected Sarah. “Remember? Alexis left.”

“Disappeared,” I corrected her. “We don't know how or why he left. Or where he went.”

Zheng looked thoughtful. He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass
back down. He glanced around at the rest of us. “Do you want to leave?” he asked. “Could you live anywhere else
now?”

I spoke up. “Yes,” I said. “I wouldn't miss this, much.” No one else said anything. I watched Adrienne's
eyes move from one face to the next.

Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze. “You
think that,” he said, “but is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying
in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”

I didn't answer.

Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.

Fact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.

My quarters felt stifling. Asphyxiating my mind. I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm,
neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I
ruminated on the situation. The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful. I inspected the arrays of
entertainment options—abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of
quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity. There was a schedule
advertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list
of dinner invitations for me to respond to. A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the
lightscreen's superficial characteristics. A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the
ship. That was all.

A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility
had similarly provided no fodder. Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes,
leftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles
of sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me.

I was discouraged and frustrated. I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship's mystery just
as much as she did. I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane. I
didn't want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences.	

I wanted my contentment back.

I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night. In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of
elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale
green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items. My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a
small table against a wall. She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along.

“Tell me,” I said, after we sat, “what you have found.” It wasn't a question.

She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me. “Not if you're
going to be rude about it.”

I sighed. “Sorry.” I wasn't, not really, but I'd lie to get the conversation going. “I want to know.” I
explained, in two brief sentences, my earlier impasse.

“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative. She reviewed the information gleaned
from our previous dinner conversations, adding, “I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to
the Pyrope Parlor. I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple
people, and they must not have known I was there. He said something about a wreck going well. And listen, when
they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”

The next time the captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along (pretending that she, too, was a
social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone), we were ready.

“Is there a doctor on board?” asked Adrienne. “I've been having headaches.” It was a lie, but we needed
information.

Jefferson nodded. “Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left. All hours.” A robot, then. Medical
AI were even more expensive than the barkeep. I wondered how many people it treated. Had anyone on the ship
ever fallen seriously ill?

“Does he age?” asked Adrienne.

“The captain?” I shrugged. “I never thought about it.”

Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face. “That doesn't answer my question,” she said.

Adrienne only picked at her food. 

“Not hungry?” asked Kishori sympathetically.

“No,” said Adrienne.

“At least have a drink,” said Sarah. “I find it takes the edge off.”

“She doesn't drink, remember?” said Kishori.

“Maybe that's the problem,” said Sarah.

“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,” said Sarah. “You ever heard of Dunbar? Well, we've got the
perfect-size group right here.” Just enough for us all to recognize each other. Just enough for us all to be
able to barely avoid killing each other.

“Why doesn't anyone mutiny?” Adrienne asked. “If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something
about it?”

“We can't,” said Ray. “What would we do?”

Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust. “You could force the captain to set down somewhere. Let
us off the ship. If he refuses, threaten him. If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there
someone who can drive a ship?”

“That's murder,” objected Sarah.

“That's survival, ” Adrienne corrected her. “Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your
life?”

Sarah didn't reply.

I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars.
Times like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire
for the night, I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it. The stillness of
the room contributed, as did the view. Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to
break the emptiness, if only for a brief time. All of it was temporary, save for the black. That was tonight's
melodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life. Everything temporary. Everything to fade away, lost as dust
and scattered atoms between the stars, and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born.

Thinking about that, I wondered if Sarah's theory was right after all. Some things in this world, we have to
make them permanent ourselves. And Jefferson, he had done that. He had made us a constant. He made this
ship—this life—a constant. The one thing that was known. The one thing that wouldn't change.

Maybe everything we did, all the stories we told, maybe it was all lies. Maybe we'd never know each other,
not truly, because we all hid behind the stories, creating the realities we wanted to see. But ultimately, this
ship, its purpose, our purpose—did it matter? We each had our own theory. Maybe that was enough. And all of us,
we were permanent characters in each others' stories. Maybe that made us more real. Maybe it made us feel less
alone.

“Mind if I join you?”

I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway. She smiled, then crossed the room to join me by the window, not
waiting for an answer. 

“Some nights,” I said, “I can't see the meaning in any of it. All these things I do, they're just to pass
the time until I die.”

Adrienne looked at me, then back out through the window. “You don't see a meaning because there is no
meaning,” she said.

After all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more. Our instinct was to
hide.

“Look what I found,” Adrienne said. In her hands was a bottle.

And what happens to Adrienne?

I couldn't find her.

Jefferson was in the Captain's Lounge, 

Fact: Sound is a vibration. The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees
Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per
second.

“Up his dosage,” I heard the captain say. “I've got a replacement lined up.”

I ran.

I didn't want to forget.

I didn't want to be harvested.

The last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors. Life boats, I thought. Every ship had life
boats. In case of emergency, break glass. I'd find one. I'd put on a space suit, I'd get out of this ship, I'd
find civilization again. A planet. A space station. Some other ship. Any place but this place.

Failing all else, I'd suffocate. Alone.

Ray, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break. “Relax,” he told me,
sliding a needle into my arm. “It'll pass,” he told me. He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing.

 
   
      
         
            
            
            The Black Willow
            
            Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close. Opening a side drawer, he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot. After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner. His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards.
            Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin. Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.
            Although the concept was a simple one, Allan thought it had potential. Besides, the public liked a good, simple romance. Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write.
            
            They gazed at each other, lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before. "What about Roger?" she asked, knowing that the answer no longer mattered.
            
            This is good, he thought, pausing to raise the low light of the lantern. I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place. I hardly dare to think it, but – I may finish this story!
            As he thought this, a sinuous wind encircled the house, slipping through the walls to chill him. The papers and the lantern's flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door. This was no stranger, however; the twisted, ancient thing was older than Allan, its branches rapping on his window since his childhood. Its thin, drawn fingers framed the bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly. The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation. Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him. His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib. In the author's eye gleamed the lantern's reflection – or was it a reflection? For while the lantern's spark shivered in the chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner's pen, scratching out the rhythm of the willow's fingers.
            
            The frenzied writing ceased at last, the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort. He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed. I did it again, he thought. After all that – so near the end, to lose control again. His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him. 
            His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders. "Come, darling," he whispered. "Where I am to take you, one need never think of those left behind." 
            They stepped together into his carriage, her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt, conveyed as if through her skin, the unearthly nature of the rails and reins, the wheelspokes. They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting. For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air. She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand. The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky. Above them, the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached. A magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky's glory.
            
            Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window. "Damn you," he cried, "will you never leave me be? Shall I never finish a story in peace?" He pounded his desk in vain, cursing the foul muse that drove him.
            
            The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor. Taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass, he glanced at his host – a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns – who passed him a silver tray. 
            "Cucumber sandwich?"
            Allan took a sandwich between his fingers. "Thank you, Arthur."
            Arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber. In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses. "How is the writing these days, my dear Mr. Clemm?"
            "Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason," Allan sighed. "I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before…"
            "Before?"
            "Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven."
            Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation. "I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic."
            "It's far from a 'penchant,' Arthur. This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."
            "How perfectly awful." Arthur grimaced at the vivid description. "I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption."
            "I know," Allan replied, "but how am I to do that? You know I do not wish to make my stories thus; but it is my nemesis, confronting me anew at every turn!"
            Arthur raised a critical brow. "Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy. Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish. There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."
            "It is true," Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, "that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher. I've even tried rewriting the corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life. My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."
            Arthur sighed and sipped his wine. "If only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours, you might write something really worth reading. It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd."
            Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees. His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had a rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on the aspect of his weariness. He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes. "I would drive it out," he said softly, "but I fear for what would remain."
            "Perhaps you require a rest from writing," suggested Arthur. "You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition."
            "Perhaps it would," Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit. "I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off. You have been a gracious host, as always."
            Arthur rose and shook his hand. "So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home," he said. "I hope soon to see you in better sorts."
            They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate. He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust. Some quarter-mile from Arthur's gate, he halted, confronted by a halloo. "Nathan?" he called out to the empty road.
            The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree. "I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today," said Nathan, "so I thought I'd wait here for you." Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton. His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy. "So, Allan," said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, "how goes life for the quintessential American author?" 
            "I wouldn't know," replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely. "I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."
            Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head. "You mean, finished another story."
            "Yes, it is finished! Ended! Never again shall it see the rosy-fingered dawn! Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine. You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential. At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see."
            "So instead, you would write – what?"
            "Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing! I want to write as others do: a tale, set in our real world, of characters who might live therein, not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars!"
            "Why is that more desirable than what you write today?"
            "People will read such stories; they are worth publishing."
            "If you never finish such stories, how can they be worth publishing?"
            "That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct!"
            "Why do you write?"
            "…Why – to earn a living, I suppose. Why do you ask?"
            "You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty. Why is that?"
            "I suppose it is because I enjoy my craft. I would not be happy, thus separated from it."
            "So at its heart, then, your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself?"
            "Yes, I suppose one could see it thus. But really, Nathan, your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level."
            Ignoring the statement, Nathan continued. "Your writing is for you, Allan, not for the publishers or some imagined audience. Since you seem unable to write 'normally,' why not embrace your tales as they are, leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure? Your stories strike a chord with the deepest, most ancient stories of mankind, the tales basic to humanity. Tell them, and they will create an audience. You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are; speak, and they shall listen."
            
            Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank. He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago. He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers. 
            His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture. He continued long into the night, until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow, raised perpetually skyward. 
            
            Arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked Allan in the eye.
            "What is this?" he queried, indicating the pages he held in his left hand.
            "I decided that… since I wasn't having much success with more – traditional – stories, I might see what sort of work I produced if I let my imagination go freely," Allan replied, somewhat less self-assured than he had been the previous night. 
            "What in G-d's name could have possessed you to do such a thing," cried Arthur, nearly raising his voice. "After all I said the day before, why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self-indulgent fantasy?" He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son. "This is nothing but a glorified Grimm's tale, a miscarried child of Stoker, a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant!" He spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that Allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from Arthur's throat. "Do you hate the modern system of literature? Do you personally despise the works the Enlightenment or the progress made since Shakespeare??"
            For a moment, Allan could hardly do more than shake his head. "No, of course not… I– "
            "Then why," Arthur barreled on, "do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble, this morbid, paganistic drivel? Why do you disregard my warnings, my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption, this literary debauchery?" He glared at Allan, eyes impaling him and demanding a response.
            "Could you write decent tales with that willow at your window?" Allan cried out at last, stepping forward and casting his arms open, confronting Arthur with this demanding, pleading interrogation. "Its twigs rap constantly against the wall, the wind always demanding my attention. How could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door?"
            Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author, viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason. "A tree? A tree forced you to write this, my dear Mr. Clemm? I must admit, this seems far-fetched, even by your standards – even your Nathan might have difficulty believing you."
            "You don't know what this is like," said Allan, shaking his head. "Nathan would understand completely." Even as he said it, Allan prayed that his statement was true. 
            "Very well," said Arthur; "then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you. If you insist on abandoning me, I shall not hold you." With that, he tossed the papers at Allan and left the room.
            Stunned, Allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order. He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away.
            
            Nathan read the package of words in silence, his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages. Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period. At long last, Nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them. Allan leaned forward unconsciously.
            "It's the best story you've ever written."
            Allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair, his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts. "So," he asked, "you don't think it's a waste of ink and paper, a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery?"
            "Heavens, no," said Nathan, aghast. "This is one of the strongest works I've read in ages. It speaks to the deepest storyteller's instinct within us all, yet is entirely original. My dear friend, you have done it. Oh, they may rail against you at first; they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage; but while those in power say such things, others will read your tales and see their true worth. Believe me when I say that you will be read a century from now."
            Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed. Nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and Allan left it with him, then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face. He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight. Certainly, it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them. His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected. These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home.
            It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last. Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead. As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door.
            Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume. He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof. Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him. The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on. As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself. The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows. He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway.
            When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself. He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done.
            Rounding the corner, he saw a great bonfire. A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house. It was a moment before he realized what else had changed: near the wall, beneath his window, was a stump with black and ancient bark.
      
   
      
         
            A Wasted Day
            Richard Harding

            
               Part One
               When its turn came, the private secretary, somewhat apologetically, laid the
                  letter in front of the Wisest Man in Wall Street.
               “From Mrs. Austin, probation officer, Court of General Sessions," he explained.
                  “Wants a letter about Spear. He’s been convicted of theft. Comes up for sentence
                  Tuesday.”
               “Spear?” repeated Arnold Thorndike.
               “Young fellow, stenographer, used to do your letters last summer going in and out
                  on the train.”
               The great man nodded. “I remember. What about him?”
               The habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin.
               “Went on the loose; had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm;
                  he’s with Isaacs & Sons now, shoe people on Sixth Avenue. Met a woman, and
                  woke up without the money. The next morning he offered to make good, but Isaacs
                  called in a policeman. When they looked into it, they found the boy had been
                  drunk. They tried to withdraw the charge, but he’d been committed. Now, the
                  probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence. A letter from
                  you, sir, would—”
               It was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere. Young men who, drunk or
                  sober, spent the firm’s money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not
                  appeal to him. Another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent
                  in Europe. In Florence he had discovered the Correggio he had been sent to find.
                  It was undoubtedly genuine, and he asked to be instructed by cable. The price was
                  forty thousand dollars. With one eye closed, and the other keenly regarding the
                  inkstand, Mr. Thorndike decided to pay the price; and with the facility of long
                  practice dismissed the Correggio, and snapped his mind back to the present.
               “Spear had a letter from us when he left, didn’t he?” he asked. "What he has
                  developed into, SINCE he left us—” he shrugged his shoulders. The secretary
                  withdrew the letter, and slipped another in its place.
               “Homer Firth, the landscape man,” he chanted, “wants permission to use blue flint
                  on the new road, with turf gutters, and to plant silver firs each side. Says it
                  will run to about five thousand dollars a mile.”
               “No!” protested the great man firmly, “blue flint makes a country place look like
                  a cemetery. Mine looks too much like a cemetery now. Landscape gardeners!” he
                  exclaimed impatiently. “Their only idea is to insult nature. The place was better
                  the day I bought it, when it was running wild; you could pick flowers all the way
                  to the gates.” Pleased that it should have recurred to him, the great man smiled.
                  “Why, Spear,” he exclaimed, “always took in a bunch of them for his mother. Don’t
                  you remember, we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds
                  picking flowers?” Mr. Thorndike nodded briskly. “I like his taking flowers to his
                  mother.”
               “He SAID it was to his mother,” suggested the secretary gloomily.
               “Well, he picked the flowers, anyway,” laughed Mr. Thorndike. “He didn’t pick our
                  pockets. And he had the run of the house in those days. As far as we know,” he
                  dictated, “he was satisfactory. Don’t say more than that.”
               The secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil. “And the landscape man?”
               “Tell him,” commanded Thorndike, “I want a wood road, suitable to a farm; and to
                  let the trees grow where God planted them.”
               As his car slid downtown on Tuesday morning the mind of Arnold Thorndike was
                  occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad, the
                  Japanese loan, the new wing to his art gallery, and an attack that morning, in his
                  own newspaper, upon his pet trust. But his busy mind was not too occupied to
                  return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by
                  some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear
                  was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full
                  tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that
                  to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding
                  a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a
                  stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent
                  youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on
                  the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was
                  not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed,
                  impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease.
               The hood of the car was down, and the taste of the air, warmed by the sun, was
                  grateful. It was at this time, a year before, that young Spear picked the spring
                  flowers to take to his mother. A year from now where would young Spear be?
               It was characteristic of the great man to act quickly, so quickly that his friends
                  declared he was a slave to impulse. It was these same impulses, leading so
                  invariably to success, that made his enemies call him the Wisest Man. He leaned
                  forward and touched the chauffeur’s shoulder. “Stop at the Court of General
                  Sessions,” he commanded. What he proposed to do would take but a few minutes. A
                  word, a personal word from him to the district attorney, or the judge, would be
                  enough. He recalled that a Sunday Special had once calculated that the working
                  time of Arnold Thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute. At that
                  rate, keeping Spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars.
               Out of the sunshine Mr. Thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda,
                  shut in on every side, hung by balconies, lit, many stories overhead, by a dirty
                  skylight. The place was damp, the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice,
                  and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans. A policeman, chewing stolidly,
                  nodded toward an elevator shaft, and other policemen nodded him further on to the
                  office of the district attorney. There Arnold Thorndike breathed more freely. He
                  was again among his own people. He could not help but appreciate the dramatic
                  qualities of the situation; that the richest man in Wall Street should appear in
                  person to plead for a humble and weaker brother. He knew he could not escape
                  recognition, his face was too well known, but, he trusted, for the sake of Spear,
                  the reporters would make no display of his visit. With a deprecatory laugh, he
                  explained why he had come. But the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did
                  not follow.
               The district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card. "Henry Spear,”
                  he exclaimed, “that’s your man. Part Three, Judge Fallon. Andrews is in that
                  court.” He walked to the door of his private office. “Andrews!” he called.
               He introduced an alert, broad-shouldered young man of years of much indiscretion
                  and with a charming and inconsequent manner.
               “Mr. Thorndike is interested in Henry Spear, coming up for sentence in Part Three
                  this morning. Wants to speak for him. Take him over with you.”
               The district attorney shook hands quickly, and retreated to his private office.
                  Mr. Andrews took out a cigarette and, as he crossed the floor, lit it.
               “Come with me,” he commanded. Somewhat puzzled, slightly annoyed, but enjoying
                  withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception, Mr.
                  Thorndike followed. He decided that, in his ignorance, he had wasted his own time
                  and that of the prosecuting attorney. He should at once have sent in his card to
                  the judge. As he understood it, Mr. Andrews was now conducting him to that
                  dignitary, and, in a moment, he would be free to return to his own affairs, which
                  were the affairs of two continents. But Mr. Andrews led him to an office, bare and
                  small, and offered him a chair, and handed him a morning newspaper. There were
                  people waiting in the room; strange people, only like those Mr. Thorndike had seen
                  on ferry-boats. They leaned forward toward young Mr. Andrews, fawning, their eyes
                  wide with apprehension.
               Mr. Thorndike refused the newspaper. “I thought I was going to see the judge,” he
                  suggested.
               “Court doesn’t open for a few minutes yet,” said the assistant district attorney.
                  “Judge is always late, anyway.”
               Mr. Thorndike suppressed an exclamation. He wanted to protest, but his clear mind
                  showed him that there was nothing against which, with reason, he could protest. He
                  could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice
                  he was making. He had come among them to perform a kindly act. He recognized that
                  he must not stultify it by a show of irritation. He had precipitated himself into
                  a game of which he did not know the rules. That was all. Next time he would know
                  better. Next time he would send a clerk. But he was not without a sense of humor,
                  and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing. He laughed
                  good-naturedly and reached for the desk telephone.
               “May I use this?” he asked. He spoke to the Wall Street office. He explained he
                  would be a few minutes late. He directed what should be done if the market opened
                  in a certain way. He gave rapid orders on many different matters, asked to have
                  read to him a cablegram he expected from Petersburg, and one from Vienna.
               “They answer each other,” was his final instruction. “It looks like peace.”
               Mr. Andrews with genial patience had remained silent. Now he turned upon his
                  visitors. A Levantine, burly, unshaven, and soiled, towered truculently above him.
                  Young Mr. Andrews with his swivel chair tilted back, his hands clasped behind his
                  head, his cigarette hanging from his lips, regarded the man dispassionately.
               “You gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me,” he commented cheerfully. To Mr.
                  Thorndike, the form of greeting was novel. So greatly did it differ from the
                  procedure of his own office, that he listened with interest.
               “Was it you,” demanded young Andrews, in a puzzled tone, “or your brother who
                  tried to knife me?” Mr. Thorndike, unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his
                  office unless escorted by bank messengers and plain-clothes men, felt the room
                  growing rapidly smaller; the figure of the truculent Greek loomed to heroic
                  proportions. The hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin, and from there fell
                  to his pearl pin, which he hastily covered.
               “Get out!” said young Andrews, “and don’t show your face here—”
               The door slammed upon the flying Greek. Young Andrews swung his swivel chair so
                  that, over his shoulder, he could see Mr. Thorndike. “I don’t like his face,” he
                  explained.
               A kindly eyed, sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon Andrews with the
                  familiarity of an old acquaintance.
               “Is that woman going to get a divorce from my son,” she asked, “now that he’s in
                  trouble?”
               “Now that he’s in Sing Sing?” corrected Mr. Andrews. “I HOPE so! She deserves it.
                  That son of yours, Mrs. Bernard,” he declared emphatically, “is no good!”
               The brutality shocked Mr. Thorndike. For the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy,
                  but at once saw that it was superfluous. From the secure and lofty heights of
                  motherhood, Mrs. Bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon
                  a naughty child. She did not even deign a protest. She continued merely to smile.
                  The smile reminded Thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by
                  Murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his
                  native town.
               “That son of yours,” repeated young Andrews, “is a leech. He’s robbed you, robbed
                  his wife. Best thing I ever did for YOU was to send him up the river.”
               The mother smiled upon him beseechingly.
               “Could you give me a pass?” she said.
               Young Andrews flung up his hands and appealed to Thorndike.
               “Isn’t that just like a mother?” he protested. “That son of hers has broken her
                  heart, tramped on her, cheated her; hasn’t left her a cent; and she comes to me
                  for a pass, so she can kiss him through the bars! And I’ll bet she’s got a cake
                  for him in that basket!”
               The mother laughed happily; she knew now she would get the pass.
               “Mothers,” explained Mr. Andrews, from the depth of his wisdom, "are all like
                  that; your mother, my mother. If you went to jail, your mother would be just like
                  that.”
               Mr. Thorndike bowed his head politely. He had never considered going to jail, or
                  whether, if he did, his mother would bring him cake in a basket. Apparently there
                  were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience.
               Young Andrews sprang to his feet, and, with the force of a hose flushing a gutter,
                  swept his soiled visitors into the hall.
               “Come on,” he called to the Wisest Man, “the court is open.”
               In the corridors were many people, and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the
                  assistant district attorney, Thorndike pushed his way through them. The people who
                  blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him. Their looks were anxious,
                  furtive, miserable. They stood in little groups, listening eagerly to a
                  sharp-faced lawyer, or, in sullen despair, eying each other. At a door a tipstaff
                  laid his hand roughly on the arm of Mr. Thorndike.
               “That’s all right, Joe,” called young Mr. Andrews, “he’s with ME." They entered
                  the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak
                  chairs. Again, in his effort to follow, Mr. Thorndike was halted, but the first
                  tipstaff came to his rescue. “All right,” he signalled, “he’s with Mr.
                  Andrews.”
               Mr. Andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs. “You sit there,” he commanded, “it’s
                  reserved for members of the bar, but it’s all right. You’re with ME.”
               Distinctly annoyed, slightly bewildered, the banker sank between the arms of a
                  chair. He felt he had lost his individuality. Andrews had become his sponsor.
                  Because of Andrews he was tolerated. Because Andrews had a pull he was permitted
                  to sit as an equal among police-court lawyers. No longer was he Arnold Thorndike.
                  He was merely the man “with Mr. Andrews.”
               Then even Andrews abandoned him. “The judge’ll be here in a minute, now,” said the
                  assistant district attorney, and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the
                  judge’s bench. There he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years
                  were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of Mr. Andrews. Seated on
                  the rail, with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to Mr.
                  Thorndike, they laughed and talked together. The subject of their discourse was
                  one Mike Donlin, as he appeared in vaudeville.
               To Mr. Thorndike it was evident that young Andrews had entirely forgotten him. He
                  arose, and touched his sleeve. With infinite sarcasm Mr. Thorndike began: “My
                  engagements are not pressing, but—”
               A court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail.
               “Sit down!” whispered Andrews. “The judge is coming.”
               Mr. Thorndike sat down.
               The court attendant droned loudly words Mr. Thorndike could not distinguish. There
                  was a rustle of silk, and from a door behind him the judge stalked past. He was a
                  young man, the type of the Tammany politician. On his shrewd, alert,
                  Irish-American features was an expression of unnatural gloom. With a smile Mr.
                  Thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young
                  judge as was the robe to his shoulders. Mr. Thorndike was still smiling when young
                  Andrews leaned over the rail.
               “Stand up!” he hissed. Mr. Thorndike stood up.
               After the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words, every one sat
                  down; and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail.
               “I would like to speak to him now before he begins,” he whispered. "I can’t
                  wait.”
               Mr. Andrews stared in amazement. The banker had not believed the young man could
                  look so serious.
               “Speak to him, NOW!” exclaimed the district attorney. ’You’ve got to wait till
                  your man comes up. If you speak to the judge, NOW—" The voice of Andrews faded
                  away in horror.
               Not knowing in what way he had offended, but convinced that it was only by the
                  grace of Andrews he had escaped a dungeon, Mr. Thorndike retreated to his
                  arm-chair.
               The clock on the wall showed him that, already, he had given to young Spear one
                  hour and a quarter. The idea was preposterous. No one better than himself knew
                  what his time was really worth. In half an hour there was a board meeting; later,
                  he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad; at every moment questions were being
                  asked by telegraph, by cable, questions that involved the credit of individuals,
                  of firms, of even the country. And the one man who could answer them was risking
                  untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice. Inside the
                  railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech. He assured his honor
                  that he must have more time to prepare his case. It was one of immense importance.
                  The name of a most respectable business house was involved, and a sum of no less
                  than nine hundred dollars. Nine hundred dollars! The contrast struck Mr.
                  Thorndike’s sense of humor full in the centre. Unknowingly, he laughed, and found
                  himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his night-clothes.
                  The tipstaffs beat upon the rail, the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an
                  indignant exclamation, Andrews came hurriedly toward him, and the young judge
                  slowly turned his head.
               “Those persons,” he said, “who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave
                  it.” As he spoke, with his eyes fixed on those of Mr. Thorndike, the latter saw
                  that the young judge had suddenly recognized him. But the fact of his identity did
                  not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered. In even, icy tones
                  the judge continued: “And it is well they should remember that the law is no
                  respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced, no
                  matter who the offender may happen to be.”
               Andrews slipped into the chair beside Mr. Thorndike, and grinned
                  sympathetically.
               “Sorry!” he whispered. “Should have warned you. We won’t be long now,” he added
                  encouragingly. “As soon as this fellow finishes his argument, the judge’ll take up
                  the sentences. Your man seems to have other friends; Isaacs & Sons are here,
                  and the type-writer firm who taught him; but what YOU say will help most. It won’t
                  be more than a couple of hours now.”
               “A couple of hours!” Mr. Thorndike raged inwardly. A couple of hours in this place
                  where he had been publicly humiliated. He smiled, a thin, shark-like smile. Those
                  who made it their business to study his expressions, on seeing it, would have
                  fled. Young Andrews, not being acquainted with the moods of the great man, added
                  cheerfully: “By one o’clock, anyway.”
               Mr. Thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves. For all he cared now young Spear
                  could go hang. Andrews nudged his elbow.
               “See that old lady in the front row?” he whispered. “That’s Mrs. Spear. What did I
                  tell you; mothers are all alike. She’s not taken her eyes off you since court
                  opened. She knows you’re her one best bet.”
               Impatiently Mr. Thorndike raised his head. He saw a little, white- haired woman
                  who stared at him. In her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men
                  who, at times of panic, fled to him, beseeching, entreating, forcing upon him what
                  was left of the wreck of their fortunes, if only he would save their honor.
               “And here come the prisoners,” Andrews whispered. “See Spear? Third man from the
                  last.” A long line, guarded in front and rear, shuffled into the court-room, and,
                  as ordered, ranged themselves against the wall. Among them were old men and young
                  boys, well dressed, clever-looking rascals, collarless tramps, fierce-eyed aliens,
                  smooth-shaven, thin-lipped Broadwayards—and Spear.
               Spear, his head hanging, with lips white and cheeks ashen, and his eyes heavy with
                  shame.
               Mr. Thorndike had risen, and, in farewell, was holding out his hand to Andrews. He
                  turned, and across the court-room the eyes of the financier and the stenographer
                  met. At the sight of the great man, Spear flushed crimson, and then his look of
                  despair slowly disappeared; and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and
                  gratitude. He turned his head suddenly to the wall.
               Mr. Thorndike stood irresolute, and then sank back into his chair.
               The first man in the line was already at the railing, and the questions put to him
                  by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney
                  and a court attendant. His muttered answers were in turn repeated to the
                  judge.
               “Says he’s married, naturalized citizen, Lutheran Church, die- cutter by
                  profession.”
               The probation officer, her hands filled with papers, bustled forward and
                  whispered.
               “Mrs. Austin says,” continued the district attorney, “she’s looked into this case,
                  and asks to have the man turned over to her. He has a wife and three children; has
                  supported them for five years.”
               “Is the wife in court?” the judge said.
               A thin, washed-out, pretty woman stood up, and clasped her hands in front of
                  her.
               “Has this man been a good husband to you, madam?” asked the young judge.
               The woman broke into vehement assurances. No man could have been a better husband.
                  Would she take him back? Indeed she would take him back. She held out her hands as
                  though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory.
               The judge bowed toward the probation officer, and she beckoned the prisoner to
                  her.
            
            
               Part Two
               Other men followed, and in the fortune of each Mr. Thorndike found himself, to his
                  surprise, taking a personal interest. It was as good as a play. It reminded him of
                  the Sicilians he had seen in London in their little sordid tragedies. Only these
                  actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not
                  know, but which appealed to something that had been long untouched, long in
                  disuse. It was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because, as he
                  appreciated, it needed expression, an outlet. He found this, partially, in
                  praising, through Andrews, the young judge who had publicly rebuked him. Mr.
                  Thorndike found him astute, sane; his queries intelligent, his comments just. And
                  this probation officer, she, too, was capable, was she not? Smiling at his
                  interest in what to him was an old story, the younger man nodded.
               “I like her looks,” whispered the great man. “Like her clear eyes and clean skin.
                  She strikes me as able, full of energy, and yet womanly. These men when they come
                  under her charge,” he insisted, eagerly, “need money to start again, don’t they?”
                  He spoke anxiously. He believed he had found the clew to his restlessness. It was
                  a desire to help; to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being
                  lifted to their feet. Andrews looked at him curiously. “Anything you give her,” he
                  answered, “would be well invested.”
               “If you will tell me her name and address?” whispered the banker. He was much
                  given to charity, but it had been perfunctory, it was extended on the advice of
                  his secretary. In helping here, he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure. It was
                  much more satisfactory than giving an Old Master to his private chapel.
               In the rear of the court-room there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn
                  and look. A man, who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs, was being
                  violently ejected, and, as he disappeared, he waved a paper toward Mr. Thorndike.
                  The banker recognized him as his chief clerk. Andrews rose anxiously. “That man
                  wanted to get to you. I’ll see what it is. Maybe it’s important.”
               Mr. Thorndike pulled him back.
               “Maybe it is,” he said dryly. “But I can’t see him now, I’m busy.”
               Slowly the long line of derelicts, of birds of prey, of sorry, weak failures,
                  passed before the seat of judgment. Mr. Thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to
                  the rail, and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope. He had
                  forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it. So great was his interest that
                  he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve, until Spear stood
                  almost at his elbow.
               Thorndike turned eagerly to the judge, and saw that he was listening to a rotund,
                  gray little man with beady, bird-like eyes who, as he talked, bowed and
                  gesticulated. Behind him stood a younger man, a more modern edition of the other.
                  He also bowed and, behind gold eye-glasses, smiled ingratiatingly.
               The judge nodded, and leaning forward, for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the
                  prisoner.
               “You are a very fortunate young man,” he said. He laid his hand upon a pile of
                  letters. “When you were your own worst enemy, your friends came to help you. These
                  letters speak for you; your employers, whom you robbed, have pleaded with me in
                  your favor. It is urged, in your behalf, that at the time you committed the crime
                  of which you are found guilty, you were intoxicated. In the eyes of the law, that
                  is no excuse. Some men can drink and keep their senses. It appears you can not.
                  When you drink you are a menace to yourself—and, as is shown by this crime, to the
                  community. Therefore, you must not drink. In view of the good character to which
                  your friends have testified, and on the condition that you do not touch liquor, I
                  will not sentence you to jail, but will place you in charge of the probation
                  officer.”
               The judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to Mr. Andrews. It was finished.
                  Spear was free, and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving
                  toward the door. Their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been
                  many. Mr. Thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment. Even though the
                  result relieved and pleased him, he wished, in bringing it about, he had had some
                  part.
               He begrudged to Isaacs & Sons the credit of having given Spear his liberty.
                  His morning had been wasted. He had neglected his own interests, and in no way
                  assisted those of Spear. He was moving out of the railed enclosure when Andrews
                  called him by name.
               “His honor,” he said impressively, “wishes to speak to you.”
               The judge leaned over his desk and shook Mr. Thorndike by the hand. Then he made a
                  speech. The speech was about public-spirited citizens who, to the neglect of their
                  own interests, came to assist the ends of justice, and fellow-creatures in
                  misfortune. He purposely spoke in a loud voice, and every one stopped to
                  listen.
               “The law, Mr. Thorndike, is not vindictive,” he said. “It wishes only to be just.
                  Nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences. But when there
                  is good in a man, I, personally, want to know it, and when gentlemen like
                  yourself, of your standing in this city, come here to speak a good word for a man,
                  we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen. I thank you for
                  coming, and I wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and
                  public-spirited.”
               It was all quite absurd and most embarrassing, but inwardly Mr. Thorndike glowed
                  with pleasure. It was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him
                  he had done well. From the friends of Spear there was a ripple of applause, which
                  no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress, and to the accompaniment of this,
                  Mr. Thorndike walked to the corridor. He was pleased with himself and with his
                  fellow-men. He shook hands with Isaacs & Sons, and congratulated them upon
                  their public spirit, and the type-writer firm upon their public spirit. And then
                  he saw Spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully.
               Spear did not offer his hand, but Mr. Thorndike took it, and shook it, and said:
                  “I want to meet your mother.”
               And when Mrs. Spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she
                  was, and how grateful, he instead told her what a fine son she had, and that he
                  remembered when Spear used to carry flowers to town for her. And she remembered
                  it, too, and thanked him for the flowers. And he told Spear, when Isaacs &
                  Sons went bankrupt, which at the rate they were giving away their money to the
                  Hebrew Hospital would be very soon, Spear must come back to him. And Isaacs &
                  Sons were delighted at the great man’s pleasantry, and afterward repeated it many
                  times, calling upon each other to bear witness, and Spear felt as though some one
                  had given him a new backbone, and Andrews, who was guiding Thorndike out of the
                  building, was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when
                  Thorndike became a banker.
               The chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with
                  written calls for help from the office. They pounced upon the banker and almost
                  lifted him into the car.
               “There’s still time!” panted the chief clerk.
               “There is not!” answered Mr. Thorndike. His tone was rebellious, defiant. It
                  carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune. “I’ve wasted most of this
                  day,” he declared, “and I intend to waste the rest of it. Andrews,” he called,
                  “jump in, and I’ll give you a lunch at Sherry’s.”
               The vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building.
               “Wait till I get my hat!” he called.
               As the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them, the sense
                  of duties neglected added zest to their holiday, and young Mr. Andrews laughed
                  aloud.
               Mr. Thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly. “I was wondering," said Andrews,
                  “how much it cost you to keep Spear out of jail?”
               “I don’t care,” said the great man guiltily; “it was worth it.”

            Captured Moments by Will Shetterly
            
                 I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home
                    for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent
                    so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to
                    preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he
                    stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept
                    her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent
                    the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us
                    little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we
                    begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. 
                 When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their
                    apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home,
                    where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when
                    I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a
                    sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close
                    to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing
                    up that symbol of their love for me. 
                 The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they
                    were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill
                    myself that night. 
            
            
                Let me begin again. 
            
            
                 I like life on the resort worlds -- always have and, after the upcoming
                    mindwipe, always will. Last year, I rented a small house on Vega IV, a sea
                    world, all islands and reefs and archipelagos, turquoise waters and aquamarine
                    skies, sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova. There's
                    only one city: called Nuevo Acapulco in La Enciclopedia del Empirio de la
                    Humanidad, it's N'apulco to the locals. The N'apulcans are mostly emigrants from
                    Polaris II; the only difference between them and their Carribbean ancestors is
                    that the ancestors fleeced NorAm tourists. Now the N'apulcans profit from their
                    Hispanic siblings. 
                 I don't mean to sound cynical. I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable
                    of a certain authorial distance, a semblance of dispassionate observation. The
                    following events may indicate otherwise. 
                 In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named. Mine was The
                    Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink. Were they
                    mood-sensitive, they would have changed as I first viewed them. The rental
                    agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive
                    either. She said, "It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?" 
                 My instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat
                    and take me elsewhere. But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may
                    say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn
                    that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism. And then, because a
                    playwright cannot resist a promising line, I said, "Your Sleeping Flamingo
                    should be put to sleep." 
                 To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature. (Allow me
                    my self-indulgences as you would those of a dying man -- when I convince my
                    mindsmith to permit the wipe, there will be another Bernardo Flynn, one who
                    knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here.) Her brows drew
                    together, creasing the lovely, caramel-colored skin around her eyes and showing
                    the pattern for an old woman's wrinkles on her forehead. Her lower lip (a trifle
                    too narrow for her face, perhaps her only physical flaw) thrust forward slightly
                    as she started to speak. She caught herself, slid her jaw infinitesimally back
                    into place, and said, "You don't like it?" 
                 I laughed. What could I do? I clapped her shoulder to show I was not laughing at
                    her. "Like it? I hate it, despise it, abhor it! It's gaudy, graceless,
                    pretentious -- That house is an affront to taste and intelligence. I should buy
                    it to raze it, but I am not so kind-hearted. I might, however, rent it." 
                 I think she only heard the last words of my speech. "You will?" 
                 "It amuses me. Show me around, and then I shall decide." 
                 "Of course, Señor Flynn." 
                 "And stop calling me 'señor'. Not even Los Mundos is so polite. Call me
                    Bernardo." 
                 "If you wish." 
                 "I beg you, change the color of the walls, at the very least." 
                 "But of course!" The house walls shifted from pink to lavender. 
                 I stared. 
                 "How's that?" 
                 I looked at her. 
                 "Worse?" 
                 I nodded. "I would not have thought it possible." 
                 She frowned. "It is rather ugly." 
                 "Thoroughly ugly," I corrected with smile. 
                 "Obscenely ugly," said she, smiling too. 
                 "No." I pointed. "It has no tower." 
                 "I can fix that." She reached for another dial on the house controls. 
                 "Don't you dare!" Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm
                    in my fingers. "I'll take it. Exactly as it is." 
                 "You will?" 
                 "I must. God knows what you might do to it next." Reluctantly, I released her
                    hand. 
                 The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise. Cloudwood had been used in
                    a Mediterranean manner, making the house seem primitive and civilized at the
                    same time. The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired. From the
                    living room, the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that Tasha
                    asked if I felt ill. All I could say was, "No. I'm in love." We both thought I
                    referred to the vista. 
            
            
                 It's strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life,
                    forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one
                    would remember, and suddenly the forgotten, in revenge, rears up to savage the
                    unwary. So it was as I wrote the preceding. My heart convulsed, and I left this
                    manuscript for a three-day spree. Apparently I was so successful that it lasted
                    a week and a half. Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has
                    his rejuve every month. And if I can brag and digress so easily, this must not
                    be painful enough to merit a mindwipe, yes? 
                 No. I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately,
                    thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them,
                    even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight. My mindsmith is not
                    so understanding. She says I am emotionally a child, to which I reply, "Of
                    course. Why else would I come to you?" This logic does not soothe her; she says
                    I must wait three weeks. Three!. Such is the law. I say I do not care about law,
                    I care about service and she should care about money. Enough. I went on a spree,
                    and it must have been a good one. I hope the wipe is as successful with my time
                    on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here. I dimly remember three bedpartners
                    who were probably human, and one that I hope was delirium. I will not answer the
                    phone for a week, no matter whose face appears on it. 
                 I keep evading the issue. But which issue? The issue of why I am evading the
                    issue, or the issue itself? To deal with the first: it hurts to remember. If I
                    am capable of love, I loved Tasha Cortez. If I am not, I had the perfect mirror
                    for my narcissism. 
                 As for the issue itself, I'm no longer sure what I want to record. The
                    playwright in me wants every scene of our time together. The editor says no,
                    only those that are relevant. The sufferer says no, only those which cause no
                    pain. And the artist says no, only those which cause the most pain, for those
                    would be the truest memories. 
                 So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise. I will not talk of the
                    first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together. I can remember
                    similar things with others. Tasha's witchery lay in making old acts new. Is that
                    love? Probably not. But it is something marvelous and rare, which is surely a
                    sign of love. 
                 If my love for her was the only important thing, I would leave a holo of her
                    with a note: "Dear Future, this is Tasha Cortez. You loved her. With warmest
                    regards, Your Past." 
                 Enough. Tasha and I walked through The Sleeping Flamingo together, and I decided
                    to buy it. Then -- 
            
            
                 This is not easy. I stand up, I walk around, I pretend someone makes a vid about
                    a writer and I must enact every cliche. I cannot decide what's important. But I
                    have learned something: writing trivializes. The Tasha who was is not the Tasha
                    in this file. The Tasha in this file is not even the Tasha I loved and thought I
                    knew. The Tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour,
                    including commercials, and just before an ad for Figuero's Flash Diapers --
                    Keeps Baby Driest!, she -- 
                 Tasha is not the whole of what happened on Vega IV. I must also write about
                    Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez. 
            
            
                 Future Self, you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between
                    the last sentence and this. Not another spree --at least, not like the other. I
                    have been re-reading all our favorite books -- 
                 But neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects, do we? 
                 I want to pick up with Tasha and me walking about The Sleeping Flamingo, and
                    then, for the sake of literary convenience, to say that from a corner of the
                    yard I saw a neighboring house, and the sight filled me with darkest
                    forebodings. But the truth is that Tasha pointed it out from the one place where
                    it could barely be seen, and I only felt envy that it had been designed by
                    someone with understated good taste. "Who lives there?" I asked. 
                 "No one," Tasha replied. 
                 Truth is always more boring than fiction. For Malaquez did not move into Dream's
                    End until four or five months after I -- we? how does one speak to one's future
                    self? -- occupied The Flamingo. 
                 I do not plan to write a book: this narrative must move more quickly. Tasha and
                    I became lovers that evening, after a good dinner of paella at her apartment. I
                    made some small joke afterward, about approving of her firm's business
                    incentives, and she cried. Consoling her, I began to suspect I loved her. I
                    moved into The Flamingo the next day; and she gave up her apartment three weeks
                    later to join me. It was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most
                    people believe it does not happen at all, the sort of romance that sustains the
                    hopeless billions who regularly watch A Wandering Star Called Love. (Which is to
                    say, you and me, Future Self.) 
                 Who was Tasha Cortez? She was a twenty-four-year-old (Terran Standard) N'Apulcan
                    who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt's real estate
                    firm. Her family said she did it to support her father, who was dying of a
                    particularly painful degenerative disease. Tasha said she woke up one morning
                    convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables, she would become
                    one. 
                 She did not like my plays. I had impressed her because I was famous and amusing
                    and not, as I had hoped, because I was a great artist. That bothered (yes, and
                    intrigued) me until I realized that she was bored by most plays, movies, and
                    vid. She did not like being a spectator. I often told her that she should have a
                    bio-check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance. I often told her
                    too many things. 
                 Search "Emiliano Malaquez" and you'll find he's a master of the "captured
                    moment" school of sculpture. Even The Terran Times has only praise for his work.
                    To compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living
                    models. He accents the illusion of reality --I paraphrase his entry in La
                    Enciclopedia Humanica --by doing life-size scenes in "the full round," never the
                    easier frontal or three-quarters view. Moreover, he never did portraits of
                    famous people; his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared
                    to it. As is typical of his school, his pieces are sealed in stopboxes. The
                    shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we're looking at an
                    instant snatched from under the hooves of time. They say the cubes will outlast
                    planets and suns, that when the universe dies, the works of Malaquez and his
                    followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of God's eye. 
                 Yes, Self, I am also bothered that this observation ignores half-eaten cheese
                    sandwiches, incomplete insect collections, and locks of infants' hair, forgotten
                    in closets, basements, and warehouses. 
                 You see the inspiration for my latest play, "Captured Moments." The mindwipe
                    will take its creation from my future self --but time too often does that
                    without aid. The play's second act concludes with the last fight between Tasha
                    and me. I have disguised us in the play, and deleted one brief melodramatic
                    interchange. Now I will mention it, in case I/You decide to restore it. Shortly
                    before she left, Tasha said, "You steal from life for art, Bernardo. You'll
                    impoverish yourself." I only snarled at her and -- 
                 My story leaps ahead of itself. Let me retreat and retrench: 
                 One night during N'apulco's mild winter, Tasha returned to The Flamingo, saying,
                    "Nardo! Nardo! Guess what?" 
                 My mind was on other things. "You wish to become pregnant? I suppose I could
                    assist a friend. Purely for the sake of the race, of course --" 
                 "Ever the altruist. Still, if I do decide, we could practice --" 
                 Later, I said, "You've been chosen to succeed the Emperor." 
                 "What?" 
                 "My guess." 
                 She batted at my nose like a cat. "Silly Nardo." 
                 "Then I give up." 
                 "Emil Malaquez is buying the house up the hill." 
                 "Oh." 
                 "You don't know who he is?" 
                 "Well..." 
                 "Nardo!" One of the many things I liked about her was that she often thought me
                    shockingly ignorant. 
                 "That's, uh..." I am never so quick-witted in person as I am on the page.
                    Especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant. 
                 "You know, the sculptor. He's had shows in Brazil and New Madrid and everywhere!
                    He may be more famous than you." 
                 "Imagine that." I remembered an article in The Medusa and a photo of a work in
                    which 100-peso notes fell like confetti onto a small Undersider, sexlessly young
                    in grimy, oversized clothing. The child's face was a warground for wonder and
                    mistrust. Imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal
                    threads in the fluttering pesos. The stars themselves might have fallen on the
                    Undersider and the event would have been no less strange, no less miraculous. "A
                    great artist will grace this world, then?" 
                 "Nardo!" She was never tolerant of my ego. 
                 "Well. What's this more-famous-than-me person like?" 
                 "I didn't meet him, jealous old one." 
                 "Too bad. If I thought he could free me from you --" 
                 "Hah!" She wrapped her arms around my stomach. "You'll never be free of me, old
                    man!" 
                 The next evening, she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing
                    sushi, sashimi, oysters in their shells, and Terran vegetables fresh plucked
                    from their hydroponic beds. Wondering about the reason for her extravagance, I
                    asked how work had gone that day. 
                 "Emil came in. He's taking Dream's End." 
                 "Emil?" 
                 "You've no memory left, old one. Emil Malaquez." 
                 "Ah. You did that to test my affections." 
                 "What?" 
                 "Calling him by his first name. I did that in a comedy once.'Nights with Karl
                    and Groucho.' It was before your time." 
                 "Oh." 
                 "The critics liked it." 
                 "I'm glad." A moment later: "That's not why I called him 'Emil'." 
                 "No?" 
                 "No. We lunched together. He's nice." 
                 "Oh." 
                 "It wasn't like that." 
                 "You're free." 
                 "Of course. Still, it wasn't like that. You think I sleep with every famous
                    person I meet?" 
                 As you may have guessed, we had talked about such things. I do not claim ours
                    was a perfect affair, only a wonderful one. 
                 "Tasha --" 
                 "Do you?" 
                 "No." 
                 "Good. I invited him to dinner tomorrow." 
                 "Oh?" 
                 "He'll be our neighbor. You say we're becoming too insular, that we need to
                    socialize --" 
                 "I've socialized for sixty-three years." 
                 "Nardo?" 
                 "Yes?" 
                 "How should I reply?" Her voice had grown quiet, and I began to feel some guilt.
                    I had, it is true, told her that we needed other company than our own. I said
                    this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel.
                    But knowing this did not mean I wanted it. 
                 I said, "Truthfully." It was the statement of a younger and crueler man than I. 
                 She screamed, "I haven't socialized with Terra's elite for most of my life! I
                    haven't socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life! And I invite a
                    neighbor, one nice, lonely man --" 
                 "I'm sorry." 
                 " --who took me to -- What?" 
                 "I'm sorry. Truly." 
                 "Oh." She studied me as a suspicious puppy might, then said, "I'm sorry, too." 
                 "I suppose I sound like I'm bragging when I talk of the things I'm tired of." 
                 "Only because you are." She smiled. 
                 I had to grin, so I did. "True." 
                 "He may come to dinner?" 
                 "If you wish, he may be dinner." 
                 "I love you." 
                 "And I, you." Months earlier, we might have sought a bed, a couch, or a
                    comfortable chair at this point. Instead, I asked, "Is he handsome?" 
                 "You're jealous." 
                 "A tiny bit. Extremely." 
                 "Content yourself, old one. He's four inches shorter than I, his nose is big and
                    broken, and --" 
                 "This is cosmetic?" 
                 "He's not that ugly. I think they're his natural features." 
                 "Interesting." 
                 "You could write a play about someone like him." 
                 "Perhaps." 
                 "I think his face is his form of vanity. It's the reverse of you with those
                    ridiculous stomach muscles. Old men should be fat." 
                 "Is Emil?" 
                 "Yes." 
                 "I am jealous. I'll eat two dinners tonight. Five deserts." 
                 She giggled. And then we did make love. 
            
            

                 I've been thinking about the mindwipe, now two days away. Who said that those
                    who forget the past are doomed to repeat it? I fear that may be true for me. Add
                    this to the reasons I write now: to remember something, perhaps even to learn -- 
                 Emil Malaquez arrived after sundown, carrying a small package wrapped in what
                    looked like real paper. His evening dress was formal, expensive, and slightly
                    stained, as that of all forgetful artists should be. He was a jovial man with an
                    easy laugh, and even uglier than Tasha had suggested. I liked him immediately. 
                 "Señor Malaquez?" 
                 "Please. Call me Emil. You must be Bernardo. Tasha's told me much about you." 
                 "All of it outrageous praise?" 
                 "All of it." 
                 "Ah, she is wonderfully perceptive." 
                 He raised an eyebrow, then guffawed. "Has she said as much about me?" 
                 "She thinks you are a genius. Do come in." 
                 "Thank you." Stepping into the living room, he said, "A beautiful house." 
                 "I'm glad you came after dark." 
                 Tasha, by accident or design, had found an innocently erotic posture on the
                    couch, where she lay with a book of M'duvian prints. "Emil!" She leapt up. "I
                    did not expect you --" 
                 "So early?" 
                 " --on time. It's unforgiveable, but you're forgiven." She nodded at the
                    package. "What's that?" 
                 "For your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home." He held it out, and
                    with a delighted "Oh!" Tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper. 
            
            
                 I stopped writing, and only the thought that I might miss the mindwipe kept me
                    from another spree. I went walking, but after N'apulco, Rio seems no fit abode
                    for a creature of flesh. I walked from this hotel to the old city, past the end
                    of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard, cracked pavement of City Park. But
                    Undersiders left me alone. Perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost. So I
                    returned, and slept, and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away. 
            
            
                 The side of Malaquez's parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen
                    of solid air. Bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a
                    friend or a bringer of food. Tasha oohed in awe. I said, "Frodo's been visiting
                    you, eh?" 
                 Malaquez said, "Your pet?" 
                 "Hardly. He lives around here somewhere. I suppose he was attracted to the
                    commotion up the hill." 
                 "Ah," Malaquez said. "Why 'Frodo'?" 
                 Tasha said, "A little fellow with big, furry feet. What else could he be
                    called?" She handed the sculpture to me. 
                 I almost dropped it; I expected it to weigh no more than a holo. "Heavy," I
                    said, as if he might not have known. 
                 He laughed. "My last piece was of four old Undersiders crouched around a trash
                    fire. Be glad someone didn't toss that to you." He spoke of his art with the
                    enthusiasm of a seven-year-old. "Um, I should wait to importune you, but..." He
                    grinned shyly. "A confession, and then a request. And then you must forgive me
                    for being so forward. It's not easy for me to ask a favor." 
                 "Relax," I said. "It's easy for me to turn one down." 
                 He glanced at me and decided I was joking. The surprising thing is that I was.
                    "Good. My last show --" 
                 " --was glorious!" Tasha said. 
                 " --was kindly received," he said. "But an artist who would stay first among his
                    fellows can tell when he begins to fail." 
                 "Oh?" I hoped no one would bring up my last three plays. 
                 "I must change my subject matter. No more urchins, dopers, vagrants, or whores.
                    I want to do more traditional portraits." He spoke quickly, prepared to be
                    rejected. "Would you permit me to do one of you? I would pay --" 
                 "Never," I said. 
                 "Ah." He shrugged lightly. 
                 "Nardo!" Tasha said. "It's an honor --" 
                 "Of course," I said. "That's why I cannot take payment." 
                 "Oh? Oh! Thank you!" Malaquez turned to Tasha. "And you as well? Perhaps the two
                    of you together?" 
                 Her eyes became circles at the idea of being, as she undoubtedly thought it,
                    immortalized by Emil Malaquez. Catching herself, she said casually, "Oh..." And
                    then she smiled, laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think
                    how much I loved her, and said, "My God, yes, yes, yes!" For a perfect moment,
                    Emil and Tasha and I were one entity, laughing until our lungs hurt. 
                 This is torture. I had not considered that I might not write to learn, but to
                    punish myself. Let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in
                    a few sentences: After giving Emil full rights to a sculpture of Tasha and me,
                    we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder, lobsters boiled on Terra and
                    unstopped still steaming on N'Apulco, and cinnamon custard for desert. Then we
                    went out for a late swim. 
                 I had drunk too much, I confess, though we all had. Somehow, Tasha and I began
                    to argue the worth of Solevgrad jazz, as inconsequential a topic as I can
                    imagine. She had studied it in school, so she thought herself as an expert. I
                    once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I
                    knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha.
                    So, I think, did she. The subject shifted from music to Tasha's obsession with
                    fame, undoubtedly by a leap that I made. She had no choice but to follow. (I do
                    not remember any of this well, just now, nor do I care to. Those who are truly
                    curious may look at the last act of "Captured Moments.") I remember suggesting,
                    with characteristic tact, that she add Emil to her small list of major
                    accomplishments. 
                 Malaquez glanced away, embarrassed. Tasha looked at me as if to say, "I will."
                    She said, "I feel sorry for you, Nardo. I'll see Emil home." 
                 "Yes," I said, "Do that," and did not care what she did, or why. 
                 Emil asked, "You're all right?" I muttered something he must have interpreted as
                    assent. They both walked up to Emil's home while I watched the scarlet moonlight
                    ripple on distant waves. Disgusted with Tasha but more disgusted with myself, I
                    finally realized she would not return that night and went into The Sleeping
                    Flamingo to drink myself to sleep. 
                 She had not come home when I woke in mid-morning. I waited, and drank a glass of
                    MorningAfter and three cups of coffee, and wondered whether our affair could
                    survive the events of the night, and whether I wanted it to. Perhaps I should
                    have invited Emil to stay, but even then I knew that sex was not the problem
                    between Tasha and me. The problem was that I have trouble distinguishing between
                    compromise and capitulation, between symbols and substance. Shortly before noon,
                    I climbed the sandy path to Dream's End, rehearsing my apology, slowing only to
                    pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet. 
                 Malaquez answered the door in blood-red pajamas and a black silk robe. Sixty
                    years ago in a similar situation, I had broken my knuckles on someone's face. I
                    merely said, "Is Tasha here?" 
                 He pursed his lips slightly, then nodded. "Yes." 
                 "May I see her?" When he hesitated, I said, "Last night was my fault. I hold it
                    against neither of you. Please. Let me talk to her." 
                 "I --" 
                 "Please." 
                 He looked me and at last said, "Very well." 
                 We walked through his house in silence. It was as attractive and as impersonal
                    as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste. A tall, narrow
                    stopbox stood in the center of one room; sand trickled forever downward while
                    beads of water splashed across the sand's path. If that was Malaquez's work, it
                    was a very minor effort. But then, I was in no mood to consider art. I only
                    wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover. That was easier than
                    despising myself. 
                 He paused before a bedroom door. "I should go in first. To prepare her." 
                 I smiled. "She handles surprise surprisingly well." 
                 "What would it hurt?" 
                 "True. Go ahead. Tell her..." I shrugged. "Tell her I love her." 
                 He studied me, then said, "I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo. I
                    didn't anticipate last night --" 
                 "I'm very good at making things happen this way. But if Tasha will forgive me
                    --" 
                 He nodded, repeated, "I am sorry," then slipped into the next room. I waited in
                    the dark, carpeted hall. A warm breeze came from silent vents above me. I heard
                    no voices until Malaquez said, "Enter." 
                 I blinked when I opened the door. Sunlight filled Malaquez's bedroom. Tasha lay
                    sprawled nude on a rumpled bed. Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the
                    bed's teak frame. She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and
                    satisfaction like one sexually content. Malaquez stood near her, pointing
                    something at my chest. Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it
                    shimmered around Tasha. 
                 The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great
                    Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor. Malaquez was not prepared for me to
                    react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not
                    have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder,
                    despair, or love. Had he been faster, he could have had rage. I threw a chair at
                    him. As he fell, I scrambled onto him, my knees pinning his arms, my fingers
                    probing his neck. 
                 I shouted, "Where is she? Tell me, or I'll kill --" 
                 He began to cry. "She left. Earlier this morning --" 
                 Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed. I hit him with the back of my
                    hand. "Tell me, Malaquez." 
                 "She wanted to be famous. She did! Now she will be." 
                 He seemed to expect me to understand. "Where!" I demanded, squeezing his throat
                    until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture. 
                 I stared at the naked Tasha. Most of his story I have pieced together since, but
                    I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy
                    throat. He had made his name with a home capturador. He began with small animals
                    and moved on to derelicts and Undersiders, people who would never be missed. Now
                    he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came
                    looking, he would say we had gone island-hopping in our windboat. Our boat would
                    disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose. His
                    story would stand in either case. 
                 I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to
                    understand. I did not listen. I took the capturador, a matte black Tiempo
                    Capturado, from his grip and studied it, not really thinking about it or
                    Malaquez or Tasha. I think I was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was
                    art, so we accepted it as art. Or perhaps I was thinking about the things that
                    humanity made that would outlive our species. But I was probably only looking at
                    my reflection in the capturador's lens. Had he said then that I should use it on
                    myself, I might have. 
                 That moment passed. I looked at Malaquez. His eyes opened wider while we watched
                    each other. His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound.
                    I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha's crypt. She smiled in trust or
                    pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could
                    never know why. 
                 The controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model,
                    but I recognized the unstop tab. I could free Tasha. If I did, one of three
                    things would happen. Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why
                    stopboxes are most often used in kitchens. Less likely: she would live the rest
                    of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's. And the tiniest chance of
                    all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then
                    she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal. 
                 As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tasha's stopbox, I heard Malaquez
                    run for the door. 
                 It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we
                    should hate. Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will
                    live as long as his masterpiece, "A Self-Portrait: Anguish," endures. 
                 And Tasha? I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate.
                    I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some
                    critics already say "Waking With Tasha" is Malaquez's finest work. If science
                    finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads
                    this file will know that my decision is wise. But I cannot stop thinking that I
                    was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death. My fear is that she
                    would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez
                    translated her into a thing that can be kept, admired, and loved. 
                 For in my way, I have done the same thing. 
                 I am ready for the mindwipe now. 

        
  
    
      
        Background
        Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the formation of
        the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)
        from glutamate. In mammals, the two isoforms of this
        enzyme, GAD67 and GAD65, are expressed from two separate
        genes, 
        Gad1 and 
        Gad2 respectively [ 1, 2, 3]. GABA
        signaling plays several roles in neuronal development.
        Early in CNS development, GABA can modulate neuron
        progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration,
        survival and differentiation [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
        12, 13, 14]. In some classes of neural progenitors GABA
        stimulates these processes while in others it has an
        antagonistic activity. For example, recent work has
        demonstrated that GABA acts in the developing neocortex to
        stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the
        ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of
        progenitors in the subventricular zone [ 14]. Later, during
        postnatal development, normal GABAergic input is required
        for activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as
        shown in the 
        Gad2 knockout mouse [ 15, 16]. In
        addition to these functions in the developing CNS, GABA
        signaling is also required for the normal development of
        non-neural tissues. Targeted mutations of the 
        Gad1 gene lead to defective
        development of the secondary palate [ 17, 18]. The cleft
        palate phenotype of the 
        Gad1 mutants suggests the involvement
        of GABA-mediated signals in the normal development and
        differentiation of a structure derived from the oral
        epithelium and neural crest ecto-mesenchyme. This
        conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate
        defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in
        the β3 subunit of the GABA 
        A receptor [ 19, 20, 21, 22].
        This intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for
        GABA-mediated signaling in the development of a non-neural
        structure, the secondary palate. The potential for this
        pathway to be involved in the early development of
        additional non-neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly
        explored [ 23]. To address this question, we surveyed 
        Gad1 transcript distribution in the
        non-CNS tissues of the embryo. Using a whole mount 
        in situ hybridization approach, we
        found that 
        Gad1 is indeed expressed in a number
        of different regions and tissues. A notable feature of this
        expression pattern is that 
        Gad1 transcripts accumulate in the
        specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the
        formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth.
        These specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be
        sources of developmental signals [ 24, 25, 26]. In
        addition, transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem
        cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal
        endoderm and mesenchyme. The expression patterns show that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several non-CNS
        structures that are derived from each of the three germ
        layers of the embryo.
      
      
        Results
        The mouse 
        Gad1 gene is widely expressed in the
        embryonic central nervous system [ 27]. To define
        additional sites of expression outside of the CNS, we
        analyzed the distribution of 
        Gad1 transcripts in E8.5 to E14.5
        mouse embryos by whole mount 
        in situ hybridization.
        
        Gad1 transcripts were not detected in
        E8.5 day embryos (data not shown). At E9.0 
        Gad1 was readily detected in the
        tailbud (figure 1A). Expression in the tail continued
        through E12.5 and was undetectable by E13.5 (figure
        1B,C,Dand data not shown), a period corresponding to
        secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo [ 28].
        Examination of sections from an E9.5 embryo revealed a high
        level of 
        Gad1 expression throughout the
        mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of
        the tailbud (figure 1F). No transcripts were detected in
        the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme
        (figure 1F). At more cranial levels within the tail,
        expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm, ventral
        neural tube, notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut
        (figure 1E). In the paraxial mesoderm, the highest
        expression levels were also localized ventrally, adjacent
        to the notochord (figure 1E).
        In the pharyngeal region of E9.5 embryos, 
        Gad1 RNA was detected in and around
        the second, third and fourth pharyngeal pouches (figure
        2A). Sections through the third pouch confirmed the
        presence of 
        Gad1 expression in the pouch endoderm
        (data not shown). Expression was particularly strong in the
        dorsal portion of this pouch (figure 2B). The additional
        diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal
        mesenchyme (figure 2B). The expression in the pharyngeal
        region was very transient; transcripts were easily detected
        at E9.5, but only faintly at E9.0 and were not detectable
        by E10.5.
        In the limb buds, 
        Gad1 RNA was detected from E9.0 to
        E11.5 (figure 3A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H). Transcripts were initially
        expressed in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER) at
        E9.5 (figure 3A,B) and by E10.5 were seen in the definitive
        AER of the forelimb (figure 3D). At E10.5 
        Gad1 was expressed in a diffuse
        stripe in the forelimb (figure 3D) while in the hindlimb
        expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm (figure
        3E). By E11.5 forelimb AER expression was fading and
        expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal
        forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb
        (figure 3G,H). The earlier activation of 
        Gad1 in the forelimb reflects the
        normal temporal order of events in limb development.
        Sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds
        was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme (data not
        shown). 
        Gad1 RNA was not detected in the
        limbs by whole mount 
        in situ hybridization after
        E11.5.
        A dynamic pattern of 
        Gad1 expression was detected in the
        developing vibrissae from E12.5 to E14.5 (figure
        4A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H). Expression was first detected in the
        supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and post-oral vibrissae and
        in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and
        maxillary rows (figure 4A,B; nomenclature as in [ 29]). 
        Gad1 RNA was also detected in some of
        the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage. Expression
        was activated in a posterior to anterior (towards the nose)
        progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows,
        reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development [ 29]. By
        E13.5, 
        Gad1 expression was detected in the
        anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated
        in the rhinal, labial and submental vibrissae (figure
        4C,D). By E14.5, expression was strong in the labial,
        submental and rhinal vibrissae (figure 4E,F). Sections of
        E12.5 whole mounts show that 
        Gad1 expression was localized to the
        epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae (figure 4G,H)
        and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate
        (figure 4G).
        Control hybridizations using a sense strand 
        Gad1 probe were also performed.
        Embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any
        staining pattern at any of the stages tested (E8.5- E14.5).
        Sense strand hybridization results for E10.5 and E11.5
        embryos are shown in figure 5.
      
      
        Discussion
        The expression results reported here show that 
        Gad1 was activated in several tissues
        outside of the central nervous system during mouse
        development. Transcripts were not seen at E8.5 and were
        first detected at E9.0. It was surprising that this very
        early phase of 
        Gad1 expression was largely outside
        of the developing CNS and was localized in the tail bud
        mesenchyme and in the pre-apical ectodermal ridge (pre-AER)
        of the forelimb bud. As development proceeded 
        Gad1 was detected in pharyngeal
        endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.
        The data demonstrate that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several sites
        outside of the developing CNS and in derivatives of all
        three germ layers. We have also detected the expression of 
        Gad1-lacZ transgenes in the
        developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and
        surprising 
        in situ hybridization results we
        report here (J.J. Westmoreland and B.G.C., unpublished
        results).
        Previous studies have shown that 
        Gad1 can be regulated at the
        post-transcriptional and translational level. 
        Gad1 mRNA translation or protein
        stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level
        of GABA [ 30, 31]. During embryogenesis,
        post-transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative
        splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice [
        32, 33]. This alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop
        codon into the 
        Gad1 mRNA and can produce the
        truncated proteins, GAD25 and GAD44, from its 5'; and 3'
        ends respectively. The studies reported here used a probe
        that will detect the adult 
        Gad1 mRNA that encodes GAD67 as well
        as the embryonic alternatively spliced mRNA that can encode
        GAD25 and GAD44. These additional mechanisms of 
        Gad1 regulation may control the
        production of GAD proteins and the synthesis of GABA in the
        non-neural cell types detected in our study.
        The whole mount 
        in situ hybridization data reported
        here extends the results of a recently published section 
        in situ hybridization study on
        E10.5-E12.5 mouse embryos [ 27]. Our analysis showed that 
        Gad1 expression is first detectable
        earlier at E9.0 and revealed novel non-CNS sites of
        expression in the pharyngeal region, vibrissae, tail bud
        and limb bud. The results of the previous study [ 27],
        together with the data reported herein, provide a
        comprehensive picture of 
        Gad1 expression in the E9.0-E12.5
        mouse embryo.
        Previous studies have noted 
        Gad expression outside of the CNS. In
        adults 
        Gad1 and 
        Gad2 have been detected in a number
        of tissues including kidney, testis, oviduct, pancreatic
        islets and adrenal cortex [ 34, 35, 36, 37]. Previously
        reported sites of embryonic 
        Gad1 expression outside of the brain
        and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens
        fibers and the olfactory pit [ 38, 39]. In E10.5-E12.5
        mouse embryos 
        Gad1 is expressed in the olfactory
        and the lens placodes, the anlagen of the olfactory pit and
        lens fibers [ 27]. We also detected 
        Gad1 expression in these tissues
        (please see figure 3Aand data not shown). Expression of 
        Gad in the developing heart and blood
        vessels has also been reported [ 27]. We detected weak
        staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel
        expression, perhaps due to the very low levels of
        expression in developing vasculature [ 27]. Our results
        document localized expression of 
        Gad1 at additional non-CNS sites in
        the mouse embryo, suggesting a potential role for GABA
        signaling in the development of these structures.
        Our interest in the role of GABA signaling in developing
        tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from
        the cleft palate phenotype of the 
        Gad1 and the β3 GABA 
        A receptor subunit mutants [ 17, 18, 19,
        21, 22]. The genetic data strongly suggest that GABA acts
        through GABA 
        A receptors to modulate the development
        of this tissue. Although the data reported here do not
        explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype, they do
        indicate that 
        Gad1 is expressed in several
        additional non-CNS tissues in the mouse embryo. It is
        particularly noteworthy that these include the AER of the
        limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae.
        Both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of
        developmental signals required for morphogenesis and
        patterning [ 24, 25, 26, 40]. It will be of interest to
        examine the expression pattern of GABA receptors in the
        mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers.
        Expression of GABA receptor subunits in adjacent tissues
        would indicate that these receptors read the developmental
        signals mediated by GABA in these structures and
        tissues.
      
      
        Conclusions
        The mouse gene encoding the 67 kDa isoform of glutamate
        decarboxylase ( 
        Gad1 ) is expressed in the tail bud
        mesenchyme, vibrissal placodes, pharyngeal arches and
        pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), mesenchyme
        and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from
        E9.0-E14.5. Some of the 
        Gad1 expressing tissues (vibrissal
        placodes, AER) are known sources of developmental signals.
        Other sites of expression correspond to stem cell
        populations that give rise to multiple differentiated
        tissues (tail bud mesenchyme, pharyngeal endoderm and
        mesenchyme). The localized and dynamic expression pattern
        of 
        Gad1 suggests a wider role for GAD
        and GABA in the development of non-neural tissues than was
        previously known.
      
      
        Materials and Methods
        Whole mount 
        in situ hybridizations were performed
        on Swiss Webster embryos as described [ 41, 42]. The
        morning that the vaginal plug was found was considered 0.5
        days of gestation. The 
        Gad1 probe was derived from an EST
        clone (accession W59173). Its 5' end corresponds to
        nucleotide 142 in exon 1 [ 43] and the 3' end is at
        nucleotide 2041 in the cDNA sequence [ 44]. Digoxygenin
        sense and antisense RNA probes were generated by labeling
        with digoxygenin-UTP during transcription. Embryos were
        removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight and
        used immediately for the 
        in situ hybridization. The embryos
        were processed as described previously [ 41] and hybridized
        to the probe overnight in 50% formamide, 5X SSC (pH 5.0),
        50 μg/ml torula RNA, 50 μg/ml heparin at 70°C. The final
        concentration of probe in the hybridization was 1 μg/ml.
        After an overnight hybridization, the embryos were washed
        at high stringency in prewarmed 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1%
        SDS (wash I) at 70°C for 90 minutes. The embryos were then
        washed in a 1:1 mix of wash I and wash II (0.5 M NaCl, 10
        mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 minutes at 70°C. The
        embryos were washed several times in wash II at room
        temperature to remove the formamide and then treated with
        100 μg/ml RNase A, 100 units/ml RNase T1 in wash II for 1
        hour at 37°C. Following the RNase treatment the embryos
        were washed in three changes of 50% formamide, 2X SSC pH5.0
        at 70°C for a total of 90 minutes. Detection of the
        hybridized RNA probe was as described previously [ 41]. The
        embryos were photographed without clearing using a Leica
        model MZFL III dissecting scope, a Hamamatsu model C4742-95
        digital camera and Openlab 2.0.7 software.
        For sectioning, embryos were embedded in Immunobed
        (Polysciences) resin and sectioned at 10 μm. Sections were
        phtotographed using an Olympus BX60 microscope fitted with
        a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.).
      
    
  
    
        
    
        
      
   
      In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre. His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake. His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers.
            But he did not weep. Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all. Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood. He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath. 
            Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate. He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read? And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit. Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality. Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind. He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current. As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him. As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants. There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass.
            Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped. Before him, roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream, grew a stand of black willows. Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground. Though the elders' trunks fell and died, their children, first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead, continued unabated, a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors.
            Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted, three-trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself. Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them.
         
      
   
    It passed.

This is my Hotel California.

I can never leave.
